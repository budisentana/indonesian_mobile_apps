Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Fidget Spinner","description":"You’ve seen them on the streets, on your commute and in your office; fidget spinners.

Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little. But they slowed the car like WAY too much.","It's an okay game. It would be better though if it didn't give you THE SAME CARS when you use cash for them. The more you get cars the more it happens. Not only that but when you hit an oil tank truck and it blows up you fall through the ground instead of landing back down. The tanks are unnecessarily overpowered they shoot at you and flip you then you get back up and flip again over over until you get wrecked!","This game is very fun, unfortunately, the time amount of time it takes to get arrested varies and the game does glitch.

I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages.

Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this?

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects.

Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self.

However, i have given it 4 stars because of a glitch that i do not know how to fix. I have made two custom characters, but I can only get one to appear at a time. one will appear, but when i edit the other one so it appears as well the first one vanishes, and can't be found under the stop sign menu. in addition, there are a lot, and i mean a lot of in app purchases, and there is almost nothing for free to play users.","Toca world is an Amazing game! It is full of imagination and creativity. It is a good game for children about the age 6-11. I have played Toca games for about 5 years now and I'm still not bored of it. For a start, when I first played Toca games I loved them! And so when Toca World came out I wanted to play it so bad because all the games were mixed together. For the positives, It doesn't have many ads at all. For the Negatives, you have to pay to expand your world which isn't much of a problem.","I love this app! And the new stuff! But this review Is not mine but is gonna be for my friend. She made a schoolhouse last night or something, Next day (which is today) everything disappeared... Some stuff are not available to get anymore :(. Like she lost the backpack from the gift which is not available anymore (I think?) I really wanna help her out but I dont know how. Soooooo the only way to fix this was telling it in a review! I dont know how you can help but... This was worth it ^_^","There are few complaints I need to make sure get patched. 1, I make 2 characters in the creator. As soon as I go to the floogle place, it only gives me only one character. 2. I put things on the walls, few seconds later it disappears also with other things it happens. Also, it won't let me open boxes. It's annoying because it's with my friend aswell.","I love this app and others do love it to but the only problem is, (why its only 4 stars) is it takes so long to load in the game for me, I have a samsung galaxy if that helps please make it load faster if you can and maybe add more houses? I think everyone would go bonkers if you added new houses and items and new hair styles and clothes, so sorry for only 4 stars but the loading could be better, but I look foreward to playing this game everyday!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tocaboca.tocalifeworld","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tocaboca.tocalifeworld&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Central Hospital Stories","description":"Hurry up doctor, we have an emergency in Central Hospital!

I have searched the internet & find lots of people that have experienced this but I can't find anyone that got it to work again. I tried to email the developers but email came back undelivered. Tried uninstall & reinstall but no luck.","This app is not working offline. It says \"your phone's mobile data is turned off. Can't help at the moment\". I wonder why does it need internet for basic tasks like calling, texting, play already downloaded music. It doesn't even wait for the command. Complaints about mobile data immediately after \"Hey google\". For me this app is useless without an offline mode.","My voice activated Google Assistant no longer works. My phone updated in software a few days ago and Google Assistant worked fine for like a day and then it stopped working again. I can only get it to work if I open the app directly or if I press the microphone button on screen. Otherwise if I'm across the room and want to ask \"Ok Google.

I think it deserves 5 stars but I have an issue. It is a bit different from Google, not just talking about its visuals. When I want to open a site from photos, it doesn't have a option. When we click on people also search for, we start getting more similar questions but it doesn't provide that. But since I needed it, I tried to install Google but it always says I can't because I have a similar app. I need you to do something about it. Beside that, it is totally awesome!","I use this because it's not as bloated as google, but there's some really stupid features. Like the fact it keeps telling me that I made an illegal request by modifying my search. Or how when I'm browsing links from the search results, it suddenly has connection issues and hangs, or how about giving users the ability to shut off lite mode? And finally, the home button is in the worst possible place for a tablet because I often accidentally hit the button when I set my tablet down every time!!!!","Keeps popping up a box saying Google lite is ready even though I have it turned off, super irritating, also don't like the auto word fixing during search, leaving me to go back and make changes while it leaves actual misspelled words in the search but changes the words that I made sure to be entered exactly as they need to be to find that info. I avoid it unless I need to use the saved log in info. Plus it has a constant feed that can't be stopped, if you touch anywhere it goes there","Far out one of my best I always prefer google is really awesome for some reason I feel good having and dealing google apps well that's me . Just makes me feel like we're on same frequency's and that's exactly why I'm satisfied even though trying other apps. I end up on same place. so don't get me wrong the mayority off times it has being a tremendously learning Exp. Nevertheless I find my self more. comfortable with google. and you might say I'm a freak not at All I'm Loyal. It's how I operate.","A little notification box pops up that says Google lite is ready now. It forces you to use it, even though the information you wanted already came up. It will continue to loop like this if you continue to search for more things.If you do select Google lite, it starts the search over from the beginning, despite the progress you have made. This is annoying, and wastes time. Hate the harsh white background. Would prefer a dark one. Would also prefer more options in the app feature."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.searchlite","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.searchlite&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bus Rush","description":"Bus Rush is an amazing running game for Android.

In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game.","I love this game so much! My sister always play this everyday. Also I was wondering if you can add more characters that look like cartoons or movies games like FNaF and your style.thank you!","The game is useless you can't even get out the respawn area at all u can't even move hardly update ur game so pepole can actually play without any issues remove the ads the game is horrible you can't even get out the respawn area at all u don't even have half the stuff needed for the game it should not be on play store no flints for the tnt and no pickaxe nothing its terrible I do not recommend downloading the game because its useless","So far it's a pretty good game, runs smoothly in multiplayer for me. I have actual minecraft so I usually only play this with a friend who doesn't. Creative mode is pretty good so far but hasn't been updated in ages. Could you add more blocks? For example, stairs, rods, signs, animal spawn eggs, and more. Oh, the ability to place trap doors lower would be a nice addition. Also could it be possible for pressure plates, sticky pistons, honey blocks, and redstone to be added in, in the future?"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"World Building Craft","description":"World Building Craft is #1 sandbox block world crafting simulator.

The different game modes are awesome, and the reward system is generous. The Hero/Villain Roster is amazing! I was playing SW:GOH, for years and the developers ended up ruining the game over the years. They focused more on making money rather than keeping it fun. The rewards became very slim. But, if this games stays the way it is with great reward drops, and fairly priced in-game purchases, I'll play this game everyday, and I'll gladly recommend it to everyone I can.","Amazing game. Is not a money grab like the avengers game. It be cool if they can bring some new cools updates. Such as Allowing to invite random people to an alliance. Able to join a random alliance. Heroic mode cost a lot of energy so there a limit of how much you can play. Overall is an amazing game. But the game might need more funding and cool features to get more players Still derseve 5 starts","Been playing for 4 years or more daily (absolutely love it). Best mobile game to date. Very in depth rpg system. Every battle can be different with tons of different play styles. We'll over a 100 characters maybe even nearing 200 now. You can play this game daily for 10 minutes or a few hours to get daily challenges it's all up to you. Or you can play in few minute increments if your a busy worker. Not pay to win, paying only helps you boost a little faster but not necessary. Favorite game!","Great game, especially for beginners, but the grind is made too long and most characters become useful only after certain Legendary Skills have been unlocked, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money very early on you won't have these abilities that make most characters good, also energy goes way too fast, and instead of having a node be playable without recharging it 3 times make it 5, a too hardcore grind right off the bat will make some players quit the game","I've been playing faithfully for three years, got all the characters, was really strong, then they go and add one character (Black Flash) that makes it where you can't do anything and die every single time. It was great until they added that character. TONE DOWN BLACK FLASH SO WE CAN DO PLAY INSTEAD OF ALL CHARACTERS BEING DEFEATED BEFORE WE CAN EVEN DO ONE ATTACK!!!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.wb.goog.dc.legends","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.dc.legends&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Talking Ginger 2","description":"Ginger's Birthday - It’s time for some birthday fun!\r\n\r\nTalking Ginger, the cutest little kitten, is growing up and wants you to celebrate his birthday with him. :-)\r\n\r\nJoin him for the best party ever - with awesome food and loads of games!

Also, I have been playing it since like 2016. All the animals are super cute and we love to work and do chores to earn some gems. There are only two problems that bother me quite a lot. One of them is that there are hardly any ways to get gems. I suggest you should put something in the app when people return to the app you give them like 50 or 100 extra gems. The other problem was that it always glitches every time it sends me out fix this now. FIX IT NOW","Pretty Good game to download if your parents aren't ok whith violence on mincraft. Not that much world to explore because computer repeats all the hills and lakes over and over again. But you do get to create your own village and unique builds, and then sell them on the build shop once you reach level 6 .you can explore other people's villages and give likes if you think they did a hefty job. So download if you can't have mincraft.","I've been playing this game for a long and I have some things to say: it's a very good game, you can say it's like mincraft, BUT, in some of the buildings I've blocked the doors so villagers can't get in but they always get in! That's quite annoying, second, I've build a little house far far from my village and now I can't find it! And third, I'm making a house by my own and I spend all the roofing and it's been 3 days and it hasn't refill that's soo annoying. Please do something about it.","I like it but in some places it might glitch but overall it's fine. I love playing this game in my free time, it just keeps me entertained. I really enjoy building my OWN buildings and I think it's a lot of fun. If the glitches were not there it would definitely be a 5 ☆ rating.

When I try ads it took long then after the ads the game would just gave me 10 minutes.....😡seriously😡..... It took long just for 10 minutes..... Please make this game good.... And im not rich to pay a online money... We dont even have credit card.... Please to the people who make this game please remake it good ☺☺","These types of games are really fun for my younger sister! She really likes the fact that you can unlock the whole thing by watching an ad for 15 minutes, but sometimes when something drops on the floor it glitches and you can hardly pick it up. Please fix that bug then I can give you 5 stars 😊","I like this game but to unlock other floors... I CAN'T BUY THE HOLE SET with online money. I have to watch ADDS ADDS ADDS to unlock the house and there is only 15 minutes....I just want to play the hole house without adds and money😭😭😭😣😣😣 AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH always adds adds adds.CAN YOU REDUCE THE ADDS AND MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 waaaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaa😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 PLS DO SOMETHING!!!!!! I am not rich I am normal. Rich people can unlock the house with online money.","this game is really fun for my younger sister and i like it too my younger sister gives this game 5 stars but i give this game 4 stars because it only lets you play in the other rooms if you buyed the game or watch ads since i cant buy this game for personal reasons i have to watch ads all the time its like ads ads ads ads ads ads i am sick of it so unless you fix that my review will stay the same","I like the game but there is only two rooms and it's not good to like solve these things it is really hard but you can invite people over so that is good and you can't watch news but the only bad thing is there's only like you can't get through the other room so that is bad"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.pepiplay.pepihome","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pepiplay.pepihome&hl=en&gl=us"}]
