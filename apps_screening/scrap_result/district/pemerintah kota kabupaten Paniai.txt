How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home. So, instead of just opening the tracker in another browser tab, the developers in their infinite wisdom have decided that it is better if you unlock your phone, open the app, and then be able to locate.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going. They need to fix that but is something I could live with it. Using Google pixel 5","I've read through your support forums. Can't find answers. Issue started Aug 2nd. All features work except sms.

Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little. But they slowed the car like WAY too much.","It's an okay game. It would be better though if it didn't give you THE SAME CARS when you use cash for them. The more you get cars the more it happens. Not only that but when you hit an oil tank truck and it blows up you fall through the ground instead of landing back down. The tanks are unnecessarily overpowered they shoot at you and flip you then you get back up and flip again over over until you get wrecked!","This game is very fun, unfortunately, the time amount of time it takes to get arrested varies and the game does glitch. The worst part in my opinion is that the hovercraft does not float"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rkgames.smashywanted","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rkgames.smashywanted&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"NewsBreak: Local News that Connects the Community","description":"News Break believes that local news is different.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much!

Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a üîê screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids .

What a waste of time it was you need different speed ups for different things like troops for example there is no generic speed up for all troop types but multiple types of speed ups you can only use for certain class plus for me to progress from where I left I have to spend a tonne of money I cant upgrade or do research unless I buy packs this is not a free to play game. It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!! And for the RICHIE RICH PEOPLE out there that loves to spend $$$$$ then go play Mobile Strike Gaming and you'll feel right at Home then tooo!!!!

With a great interface, nice preference options, and new tabs for special issues (Elections, COVID, Olympics, etc.). I find the issue of ads overblown, and are fairly limited. Overall, this app is definitely worth it for those looking for diverse news.","I've used this app for years now, and I've liked it a lot. Ads are getting way too intrusive now, they're injecting ads into every news story that you open, On the main feeds after every three news articles was an ad, and with the latest update the ads are now showing large graphics. And also when you open the story and then try and exit ads are popping up, and in some cases prompting you to install software which is dangerous as hell. Just about at the end of my rope with this app.","Love the app, it's great for getting news from a lot of different sources. Recently updated and had to ability to pick topics I am interested in. Only reason its 4 and not 5 stars is I wish you could also pick news I don't want to see. Like I see WAY too many articles by news sites that are extremely biased (uber left or right), just wish there was a way to filter certain sites out.","Used to be a great news resource. Now it's littered with ads that you can not back out of. You have to completely close the app! Each article is just packed full of ads; it's hard to read the article itself! The \"top\" news source that is forced on you is where a lot of the ads are too! You can customize other interests but you have to navigate between the article itself and the annoying ads. Time to look for a new news app!","I've had this app for quite a while. I like it alot. Format is good. Recently, it's getting glitchy. I keep reinstalling it in hopes of improved performance. Hasn't helped. I have a pixel 3a. It's a strong phone so I don't think it's my phone. Good luck with bugs. Good site otherwise. I must add I agree with others that ads are killing it. I don't mind some but video ads and page block adds don't cut it. Unless improved, I'll be bailing out."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"jp.gocro.smartnews.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.gocro.smartnews.android&hl=en&gl=us"}]
