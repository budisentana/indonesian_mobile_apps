There are 2 modes, system smash and planet smash. Planet smash has a large variety of things to destroy planets with, and you can create your own planets. System smash only has a few weapons, and its like universe sandbox in a way. A few things I would like to see, are a bit more weapons in the system smash, and a bit more realistic things, like if you melt the polar ice caps the world will flood. Once that is done, this is a 5 star game","It's good, but the 1 thing that really annoye me is I have tried getting the Cube World with the orange laser and the grid, but even though I make the best cube. I don't unlock it. So can you guys please fix it! I think other people around the world are suffering from it and are sad and mad. Its a really satisfying game it never gets you bored.","A fantastic and amazing game. Can't wait to see what other tools you guys come out with. Edit: One of the recent updates made the game not recognize my remove adverts purchase, and it doesn't allow me to make the purchase again. Hope this is fixed some point soon. Solar Smash is still great. Edit edit: Reinstalling seems to have helped. Nevermind.","Have had paid version for a little while, and enjoyed it a lot. But, now with the 3 new weapons, WOW! a LOT better. All 3 are entertaining as all get out. Highly recommend. NOTE: Even tho have paid version, after update (8/2/2021) I had a full screen ad show up. WHAT GIVES??","Extremely realistic graphics, a lot of planets, the new solar system mode is fun, you can modify the damage of some of the weapons, and.. it's a game to play in free time like 30 minutes.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth! Had huge glitch on my game play, took a couple of weeks to fix, they got it done!!! Thank you all. Awesome job well done. Totally locked in forever. 👍👍 Once again the Tech Team has stepped up to Excellence. Thanks 😊 7.21.21","Fantastic idea ! 2 stars missing because this game does not load properly. Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building. It also have military, airport, railway, minerals, space oruented,....etc 3.In each and every places has unique song i really have enjoyed it. 4.

You can't search within a podcast so you have to scroll until you find the one you want and since they are ordered from new to old, if you let it play automatically, it'll play \"in reverse\" (i.e. Part 2 would play before Part 1.) and every now and then, instead of staying the next episode, it'll go back to the top and play the latest.","When it works nothing beats it but lately it is worst than Sirus.....which is bad. Cuts out every half song...then I wait about 5 minutes and some times it comes back but mostly I need to stop the song and restart it. Very frustrating when trying to get a tan on a beach. The web site on the computer is #1.... but the app for the phone is a big ZERO.","I totally love this app!!! It works good, but there are two problems with it. There are too many ads and also I also had trouble for some time keeping the Bluetooth connection when I open the app and play a radio station or podcast or anything on the app. I know there is nothing wrong with me Bluetooth speaker. My speakers are fully charged and I can play everything else on it. Can you please look into it?","I used to enjoy this app more in the beginning but now not so much. I could add and delete songs and it would only play the songs I added. Now you can't delete any songs and it plays random songs not added by me. Also you can't add any Garth Brooks songs. I even tried the free trial for premium and still no luck. I tried to listen to Garth Brooks radio with unlimited skips and I heard one song from him and skipped over 50 times and nothing. I am currently looking into other music options.","Commercials, Commercials, Commercials! If you like Commercials, then this is the app for you. Every time I use the app, I have to FIRST LISTEN TO FIFTEEN COMMERCIALS before I actually get to the station. I upgraded to the plus service, but to no avail.

I would like to see when it asks for my age to also have the option to just sign-in to google play games where my entire city is backed up on. Its extreamly frustrating and after all these years I highly doubt I am the only one.","It's a great game, playing for a few years, will keep playing. Would like to see more design element control. Turn off building upgrades, even force no upgrades. While you can play, it's rather 'pay'. My children can't get far in this game. They need $$$. I don't mind paying, yet this game is a cash cow ! Very greedy game. Visit another city you may get $5, that's like worth 10 cents. Not a great reward. War rewards are terrible. Global trade hq, always hiding what you need. EA reward time !","Had a good time with this for a day, until I hit level that unlocks schools and transportation. Then I realized it would take forever to get the money for those buildings, and that's when the game so conveniently showed me some rather expensive options to get them immediately. Of course it did... Typical EA. Uninstalled.","Halfway decent game Graphics are cool, but unfortunately just like every other game out there on any tablet or computer or phone you got to pay to play prices are too high for some stuff but they do that so if you have to buy to be able to build City you want. I'm not on very often to play just because of that, maybe they should rethink your s*** because the prices are way too high and it's not like he has any overhead cost in production of this stuff","The game is good, the graphics, ambience, and the day and night cycle is just so amazing! But one thing I've noticed is that as you progress and as you build more buildings, it gets harder to renovate and to edit your city and it takes so much time to move all your buildings by holding it one by one and moving it all to the corner just to insert an another building. It'd be better if you'll add a city layout edit where you can store all your buildings & roads at once and place them freely.😅"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.ea.game.simcitymobile_row","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.game.simcitymobile_row&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Wikipedia","description":"The best Wikipedia experience on your Mobile device.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"}]
