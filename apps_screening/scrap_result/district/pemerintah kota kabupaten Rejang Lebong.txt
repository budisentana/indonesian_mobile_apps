How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home.

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little. But they slowed the car like WAY too much."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rkgames.smashywanted","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rkgames.smashywanted&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Block City Wars: Pixel Shooter with Battle Royale","description":"5..4..3..2..1..

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

The first page it opens when you click on the app, says that the service is offline. And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going.

Get the latest version for all available features and improvements.","comments":["The publisher keeps trying new tricks to get you to buy outrageously expensive options. For example the Extra allows you to see many more profiles, that is until the automatic refresh of the screen happens. Then you need to find where you were. Nothing fhis or any app can provide thats worth $40 a month. What the hell is wrong with these people? And when you get to the end of the list, they tantalize you with profiles you can't get to unless you pay the $40. Not S bad as Scruff, yet.","There is no better dating app. This app comes with zero qualifiers; it's the best. The free version is so much like the purchased version. I go with the free version. I've had the purchased versions. I don't like how the prices change so if you can get a good cheap version get it but Grindr is the best... [they should have called it \"Fruit by the foot\" because the milage thing]","Had trouble renewing regular subscription as well as purchasing a new subscription. Both Google and Grindr could only offer obvious, useless suggestions and ultimately gave up, ignoring requests for assistance in purchasing; good for them: on my own, I finally was able to purchase a new subscription at a much higher cost. At least now I understand why they wouldn't help.","If there are stars rating for how bad this application I would give 10 ! I would really like to know why i am paying 60 CHF for an application that keeps crashing all the time? Connection lost all the time, messages not sent. And what ever refresh doesn't work. I need to close and re open it, so frustrating! And spams, don't let me start with spam, I am not basically texting other guys here, am spending my time reporting and blocking the spam i receive. For such high price, fix it pls !","App good however, when I block they should stay blocked and not pop up later. In app adds should not come up after every block. Other than 1 stalker which is not a grinder issue but is freaking me out a bit, the app is good and I have met some really decent guys.

I redownloaded it but Im looking and it says I dont have the premium version anymore. Edit: So that was a year ago whenever it first didnt let me access my purchase. But I just downloaded this game again and I have access to it now xD. So um I give it 4 stars","I decided to download the game again after a few years and it's still a great time killer. Plus the in app purchases aren't unreasonable like other games in my opinion. You can get everything in the game + no ads for only 5 bucks which is pretty good.","I have a suggestion. since I have bought all the maps and cars, I have been playing for a long time. I decided there should be a sandbox mode in the game and that you build and create your own map and use your own imagination to set your map up and you can save the map and name what even you like.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively.

I love the concept of being able to customize I've played this game for years and I've been on and off with it. I had the game downloaded about two years ago and had no problems. But now in 2021 whenever I try to play the game freezes and I cant do anything except the info button and once I restart it, it says my profile has been banned for unauthorized activity even tho I havent played the game in years. Plz help😐","It's a good game, the reason why I'm giving this a 3-star is because I have a lot of problem since I was playing this game, sometimes when I fight the enemies once I drop their hp to 0, they still stay alive, and my other problem is it's hard to get rewards, I would suggest increasing the drop rate after winning the game, my third problem is the energy cores, it takes too long to recharge them back again, that's all.","Good game all around and though I do prefer the original version for sure this is quite the upgrade in terms of origins for the bot, also while I do find some of the items can be extremely expensive there are often ways to counteract this such as with the upgrading parts to silver gold etc: the solution I found was to do sparring matches on pro every time I got 5 energy cores until I had enough cash. This is still an amazing game, thanks alot","Really enjoyed playing this game... Loved the ability to make your own robot from a wide range of parts, moves and designs. Just one thing though, when my screen doesn't show attack effects, like the sparks and hit effects, does it have to do with my phone or the fact that it is an android one?","I love this game but it is a little hard the the beginning the ai is tough and you can only fo five fights until it recharges but once you reach pvp it gets a lot easier cause you get things called cores for robots and another currence and you can sometimes get enough cores to get an elemental part which is only like 150 cores which are not hard to get."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.reliancegames.rschampions","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reliancegames.rschampions&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"MetroPlay","description":"Welcome to MetroPlay, a FREE entertainment destination that includes hit movies and over 90 of today’s most popular channels, created exclusively for Metro® by T-Mobile customers.

From their insiped patter that they make their phone reps say, to constantly interrupting me to say \" Oh! I'm sorry to hear that\" can they sound any more phoney? And let's talk in store (a corporate store) they talk down to customer, type comments on your account that they refuse to show you. And don't believe them that it's needed. I just had an employee log on; find my account and expl. the problem all in 3 mins. The rest: LAZY and RUDE!!","I never have used this app and not sure what it even offers other than the obvious given by its name. Sorry If I were to have to rate metro, on the other hand I would not give it a good rating because my calls were always dropped, I rarely could get good service and they never wanted to compensate for what I paid for there service. Thus being why I left them for a different service provider😉 Thank you","Don't blame MetroPCS customer service for the problems that T-Mobile creates for the customers of MetroPCS. MetroPCS has people who can help you with general problems thata person might have with the new technology Remember how expemsive it was to get help with your computer when you had an issue?

If this happens on continual basis, I will definitely lose my interest and likewise many more...","This is an incredible game that I just can't get away from. It's not like other games where you are forced to watch ads to do anything, so that's a huge plus. I can never get bored of this game and I'm in love with the character designs and the graphics and everything about it. There is a power system, stopping you from playing for hours and hours, but I like it because then I can get out and do things, instead of being a couch potato. Thanks for creating such an amazing, fun, game!","The Game is well designed in appearing the smallest deatails of each character, however each variant of the charter all ways has the same special 1 and 3, to make it appealing and interesting you could change the super speacial to something a little different to other character. The survivor mode is fun but the wheel of fortune is not balanced in terms of probability, i tend to get more crystals then any other prize on the wheel. But over all its a whell designed game.","This game is epic I love how it is offline because all offline games are soo boring unlike this one. I think there needs to be an update and include more player though. On my tablet this game is perfect but on my phone for some reason after I've played a battle it goes off the game and into my home screen so I never get my XP and have to do the fight again but it still takes my energy bars and the process repeats so I dont move on. Please help me fix this","I have been playing this game for queit some time now and i really do like but there are some issues in the game that really need to be fixed.
