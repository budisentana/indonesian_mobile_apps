Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

It's pretty fun! There's several rooms, enough to keep me busy and entertained. And the characters are also very silly and creative which I like.. like there's robots, astronauts, bubble guys and fish too. The best thing about it was all the stuff there was to grab and click on... And it truly represented a real hospital with all the different areas including the waiting rooms and parking lot where the ambulance pulls in. 👍","my cousin can't play every time my cousin go's in the app. she watches a ad to unlock the rest of the floors but it freezes. and never lets her in the app there's no x button to go back into the game. then she resets the app same thing happened. please fix this for my cousin she plays on tablet by the way. she keeps on bothering me so fix this glitch. Edit: yes I can see the ad I deleted the app then installed it still same thing it's stuck the number the timer that tells you when the ad is over","I would give this game 5 star rating but it isn't PERFECT, its fun and inspires you and this goes for every game of Pepi I m disappointed because I can't have ALL of the levels of the building. You can watch a video but that only gives you 15 minutes to play with every thing. Please fix this and make all levels playable without ha b ing to play","It's fun to know but you have to watch and add every time a timer runs out and it doesn't even give you that much time I would rather just not download the game at all because there's barely any rooms that are free you have to watch ads to get them and the ads are so long I rather you just pay for the entire game then have to watch it at every time you want to play it","This game is amazing! I can take care of patients and heal them if they have broken bones! I can also take care of babies in nursery, and so much more! I love this so much, This is the BEST hospital game ever! And because I wanna grow up to be a doctor, this inspires me even more! I highly recommend this. I can watch an ad to unlock everything for 15 minutes! It's worth it, and I'm very happy with this game! It is so much fun and it's also really educational for kids.

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently.

I like to display the speedometer in full screen. Unfortunately the maps are not accurate, I found 5 places around my home where the speed limit in Amigo is 130 while it should be 90 (it has been 90 for years). One place where it is 90 while it has been 130 for years .. I found a missing roadwork that has been there for 2 years... Unlike WAZE it is not possible to report a map error. I tried reporting a hazard with \"OK Google\" I then had a prompt to choose between apps.","Voice guidance needs to be a bit more often, especially when motorways split in 2 and lanes take you in different directions. From what I see of the interface it looks OK. Map design looks nice and clear. Option to see a full list of turns would be good, also option to report police, stopped vehicle or hazard on carriageway. Ability to add a via point or search for fuel on current route. Hopefully next update will fix bugs and I'll try it again.","Great alternative to Waze, but missing the refinements of Google maps. The map is bright, simple and easy to follow on Android Auto. However, they really need to think about having an alert only mode, as using this for the morning commute is like having a toddler in the passenger seat, it just doesn't shut up! Otherwise, it's a great start, but certainly not as polished as Google Maps.","Brilliant! Much much better than Waze. Which I won't use again. This one actually works. Clean, simple to use with everything I want from a navigation app. The only need is better voices. But my only two gripes stopping me giving 5 stars is that the maps sometimes are not totally accurate and the GPS is very slow at keeping up (especially when turning onto another road). Otherwise brill!","There is much to commend in this app, routing is good and the screen is clear, but there is some way to go before I discard Google Maps or Waze. The voice is awful, an aggressive American female with no street names and variable volume, even within instructions. The map zoom is not evident and I am not sure I can navigate by voice commands on Android Auto.I did try Google text to speech but it made no difference."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tomtom.speedcams.android.map","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tomtom.speedcams.android.map&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PlayKids - Cartoons, Books and Educational Games","description":"Children learn to read, watch videos, and read ebooks.

Thank you for playing Thomas &amp; Friends: Go Go Thomas","comments":["Bought the full package to open everything on my main account for the kids. However when logging in it still shows that everything is still locked. This is due to I have 2 Google accounts on my phone and the app realized that I didn't pay on the other so it won't unlock until I remove the other account. This is dissapointing since paying a stupid amount to unlock full features for the kids is sad enough. Now I have to remove then add my other account back on everytime my kids played the game.","What a perfect app. Best for Thomas Train racing . We need to pay for buying packs and other engines! Why? Please make those free and make a option of coins so that every pack/engine will be unlocked by the amount of coins you earned? Please put it. That's why 2 star(s) is missing. THANK YOU. And I have changed my phone but still you have not changed anything. Please fix it.","My son loves this game and so do I. The only addition I am thinking of is maybe listing the engine names at the pre race screen to help him associate the spelling of the names with the pronunciation and engine. Loved Thomas and friends when I was young and now I get to enjoy it with him. Hey, who do I talk to about bringing back Rheneas and Skarloey?","I am very disappointed by the in-app purchase mechanism of this game. I purchased the game for my nephew using his Play Store email profile on my mobile phone. The reason for doing this is to ensure that I have the purchase credentials on my phone. That didnt work. At all. To avoid the disappointed look in my nephew's face, I put in my payment credentials in his tablet and purchased the game. Now I have purchased the game twice & Google Play is refusimg to refund my second purchase. Pls help.","I mostly liked the actual cartoon but then when I actually figured out that this game was way way to awesome. Since I loved trains, I had to install this app. I am a gamer after all. This is my favourite game yet. I love it, way to much, and mostly Thomas, since he is the main character.

It's supposed to be that way. This game has a lot to offer. I can't do the minigames like make the worm go through a hoop, like 18 hoops in 2 minutes. I am lucky to get 8 of them in 2 minutes. Or bump the crates to make them hit the enemies. I am lucky if i can even bump the crates. I would like it if it had more sounds.","SUPER COOL,but as much as i hate to say it,theres a problem!It need energy to play missions and stuf and when run out energy and ads.you can play!so it makes it worse please cancel energy bc i ruin all th fun.👒😔😃","Constant Push for Microtransactions.

Now you have the big jump Or whatever its called which doesnt work at all. Please put back EPIC GROWL , IT WAS BEST EFFECT EVER and please make fireballs free so game is more enjoyable instead of having to watch ads constantly and only play game in between ads. Also i notice right after you give me 6 fireballs the game ends and this happens alot, so why dont my fireballs come with me to next round? That would be fair since i have either","Really fun games! I even can play it offline and the app size is small. But for me the worm's movement control a bit \"wild\" and too fast.

What a waste of time it was you need different speed ups for different things like troops for example there is no generic speed up for all troop types but multiple types of speed ups you can only use for certain class plus for me to progress from where I left I have to spend a tonne of money I cant upgrade or do research unless I buy packs this is not a free to play game. It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!!

Amazing graphics and great quality! Fits perfectly for any age aswell. For a start, I have played this game for 3 whole years and there's been no lags, no glitches and the game has never froze. For the positives I really appreciate that when there's going to be an add, They inform you about it at the bottom of your screen. For the Negatives all I would say is could say is could you please add more backgrounds for your character. Other than that it's a brilliant game! 🥰","This game is so fun and exciting to play.My friend and I have been playing it for a while and we decided to make an review to give you ideas to upgrade the game like making it an online game that you can play and add your friends,with mics to communicate with eachother, and to trade plushies.It would be amazing if you can do that to make the game much more fun and exciting.","This is A good Game for Children and teens. But other than that, There's too much ads and the glitches are creepy. Once that I was playing Gacha life. Suddenly An ad came And the Characters were the same. Also the Characters name is \"character\" so I left the game and Replayed it. Then everything was fine. But.. Can you please fix this? it would be Helpful.","I love the app!,it's very useful to make a channel and there is so many stuff you can use you on your avatar!,but I hate that they removed so many things,like poses that was useful. I know that we all have gacha heat but at least a pose that is grabbing something while sitting and a tongue out no?,please add some of the old features and this will be really good app.","Great game! I still dont understand why people use this game in the wrong way. Something that would be cool is that you can add something where you can take a picture of yourself and it will create a similar character. Or there could be a contest thing where you create your own clothing, upload it to the game, and it could be created into actual clothing you can use in the game!Why did I rate it 4 stars?

Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.\r\nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\r\n\r\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\r\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings.

As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

But if you used all the medals you earned you could recover about 1/3 of that , maybe a little more. So it takes a little more than 2 days to earn enough gold to make the nesasarry upgrades to ships, drones.","In general, good. Takes a long, long time to upgrade unless you PAY for items. Developers means of support I suppose. If not willing to pay for items, may eventually lose interest. Update, extremely hard to Update ships. Have to pay for gems. Now a new Update won't go through without an Uninstaller. Update to game again. Made harder and less gems to upgrade.","Before recent updates, I played daily and it was fun. With the updates the game is a boring grind with little merit. If the devs offered a \"version 1\", prior to the updates, I would play that daily. This new version has lost me as a player. The devs have driven the game to p2p, especially for gold. Ship and engine upgrades are nearly impossible to achieve as f2p as gold is non existent. Don't recommend this game. Greed has turned this to a game of disappointment and drudgery.","Been playing for 2 years and with the recent update I cannot see me playing much longer. It is now impossible -unless you wait and farm for months on end- to upgrade without spending a lot of money. Theres no fun in it anymore. If you are willing to spend thousands of pounds then jump in, but if not, you'll get nowhere in this game. Its a shame as I really liked it, and would have spent on the odd upgrade, but now, I'm done. Their greed will kill them.","Awesome game and gameplay great graphics no lag multiple things to keep you busy ie pvp endless mode boss mode trials easy medium and hard levels. Reason for 2 star loss is offer wall does NOT make it easy to collect completed tasks, customer service email address is always under maintenance and the Facebook messenger option just says thanks but nobody here right now. I've been waiting 3 weeks even after the offer was approved for my gems by outside source still no gems from devs 😒😒😒"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"invaders.os.galaxy.space.shooter.attack.classic","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=invaders.os.galaxy.space.shooter.attack.classic&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Real Steel World Robot Boxing","description":"Join Atom, Zeus, Noisy Boy, and many more of your favorite Robots in the battle for supremacy of the Real Steel universe.

Best part is that you dont have to upgrade your bot really to beat the boss, maybe just one or two. Also, no need to really purchase anything, just do good combos. The only bad thing is that you have to get google play so if you delete it you dont have any progress, make sure you save the progress!! To help you if you have trouble winning, purchase these robots: UWI Ambush UWII Six Shooter WRB I Gridlock WRB Albino WRB- Metro Gold","Overall, this is a good game. But, I bought a bunch of stuff on my iPhone, and logged into Facebook hoping to transfer my games data over to my Android phone, only it find out that none of it transfers across phones, but I can still log into Facebook. This is a little more than anoying, and if there's a way to fix the problem, this is an easy 5 star game.","I'll start by saying that a few days ago this would've been 4 starts as it's a fun game but the energy system slows it down. Today I got on and the game told me I hadn't beaten UWI yet? How? I have two WRBII robots and I was getting ready to fight Zues. So I though eh whatever I'll play through it really quick. So I equipped my old UWI robot and tried to go through the championship again. I beat UWI logged on the next day and the progress was gone once again. I still have all my robots and stuf","OK, all I can say is 'OUTSTANDING' with brilliant gameplay, astonishing graphics and gorgeous mechanics of the game itself. This one's better than the boxing champions I'm telling you. Gives me back many nostalgia! Playing since 2013 (it's first release) and I see there's alot changes now that really improved the game and impressed me, the mystery draw was a great thing coz you can win alot of unique robots like Zeus, Atom, Cosmobot and more! Good job reliance!","This game I'm played in 2016..all the stages completed..after I deleted the game..now in 2021. Again I downloaded and started playing..but I don't know there is a small problem I'm facing..3rd of August 21 massage I can see device blocked...why I can't understand...my all the ability cards and transform cards gone...what is this new problem??"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jumpgames.rswrb","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jumpgames.rswrb&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Baby Panda Home Safety","description":"Home is a special place.

I am a big fan of sonic the hedgehog and I really think this game suits me. It also merges other sonic generations and dimensions with the characters. But just one issue is when I change the graphic settings to high, my game just glitches and when I am running it looks like it's playing one frame at a time, please fix this! :(","Pretty good overall. They should fix the match ups and make ultra rares easier to get. Not exactly the most F2P friendly, but is still doable even if you don't spend any money. There are many ads, but you do not have to watch them, they are mostly for getting things done quicker. They should bring back party match though. That was a great addition.","Its a very fun and addictive game and I have spent many hours playing since it was first released. I would've given five stars if it wasn't for the fact that the \"Space Shooter\" Unity ad that appears when doubling collections on missions or opening silver chests never issues the reward after watching or playing it so I have to keep pressing the watch ad button repeatedly until I get a different ad that does reward me. Please ask your ad provider to remove or fix this ad please Sega Hardlight!","The amount of grinding you have to do to level up your characters is horrendous, even if you max out a character, you can still get them in chests which can be a big waste of time and money. Buying chests from the shop is way too expensive. Your money is barely worth anything in this game. But, it is pretty fun. Despite its degenerate money scheme.","This game is pretty fun. Been a bit since i have played a good phone game. But this game needs a better match making system. Should not be playing against people who are seven levels ahead as in player account and character. With their top speed it is impossible to catch up even if you have max coins and dont mess up or even get hit.

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Offline GPS Navigation, Traffic & Maps by Karta","description":"The most customizable GPS Navigation app in the world! \r\nDownload any map in the world or individual US State, customize your GPS Navigation experience with a funny voice and navigate on screen using a sports car, a police vehicle or even a spaceship. \r\nEvery road map is free and allows you to navigate offline without an internet connection with detailed turn-by-turn driving instructions. \r\nOn this version you will also get speed and radar alerts with LIFETIME updates,  live traffic alerts and a comprehensible on-screen speedometer.\r\n \r\n \r\n🆓\r\nNo costs no worries.

This app is funny. It shows you a layout of your route. But it is really horrible in showing real time update of traffic situation so can never trust the ETA provided by this app. It goes with the logic that all roads are clear and only you are driving all alone on the roads shown by this app. FUNNY app.","Looks good. Uninstalling though...two critical issues: 1.) Address Search- I cannot finish my input in the search field as the app pauses my input because it id actively searching. I have to wait just to complete a single word; 2.) In the US, hwy are known for their numbers I-40W, I-15N- Hwy79E etc. Sections of freeway are named, however they are of no use at tiime of Navigation. Traffic is so fast especially around freeway jct the only thing that is useful are freeway numbers and direction.","Omg. I used this app in Canada. Downloaded all relevant maps and the darn thing would have sent me to Timbaktoo. Whenever a highway intersected with mine, it would tell me to exit. I had to dig out my old, not updated for years, Magellan GPS, and guess what it safely navigates me now on my journey from the east to the west of Canada.","I thought this was a 3D Navigator??? There are no icons on the map at all. I thought purchasing the ad removal would be a great idea but I guess not. Where are the 3D icons on the map? Do you have to purchase icons now? I had this app years ago & don't recall having to do that. 🤔","I just downloaded this app and i didn't try yet how its working but I'm giving 3 stars because have to much ads and many people is getting pissed off of the ads if u want this app to become a best app like Google maps, waze or tom tom u need to block the ads £2 for me are nothing but why i need to pay to block the ads when i can use other maps without ads"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.kartatech.karta.gps","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kartatech.karta.gps&hl=en&gl=us"}]
