It is so much fun! With endless tasks and level ups, feeding your animals and flying planes in and out, what more could you want in a game?! You can play this farm town game and become friends wjth family and friends to help out their town and send little gifts every now and then! If you think yiu want this game, dont hesitate to download! Just do it!!!","The game has changed so much. Its definitely not like it use to be. I keep getting burnt out. It's hard getting the materials you need to upgrade your barn. Especially after level 100. I usually buy the gold pass but the last few times I bought the pass I couldnt finish all the tasks. It's very frustrating. Also I think there should be a separate storage for materials. Its very frustrating that the barn fills up because you have materials you have to hold onto to build the zoo enclosures.","It is the best game i ever played...something that can catch your attention at first, makes you play without noticing time, and makes you feel intrigued how the game will progress. It makes you finish your current level and feel excited to reach the next level. Overall, its great except that there should be an option that you can play it offline too.","i love this game so much I'd play it often. but now it's extremely frustrating to constantly go back and see my progress not being saved. I'd had already gathered and planted crops, filled helicopter orders and bought buildings, and it just disappears when I come back saying I have to do it again. fix it please asap, it's annoying and for now I won't play until I see it's fixed.","UPDATE: July, 8, 2021 I had to get a new phone and when I reinstalled the game it reverted back to the beginning! I've contacted the developers multiple times and all they did was send useless links that didn't restore my game back to the level it was at. I've played this for a year or more, I've advanced far and spent lots of money on this game. I'm so upset!!!!! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.playrix.township","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playrix.township&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Likee Lite - Let You Shine","description":"Likee lite is the lite version of Likee.

Loud ads KILL this app!!!! It is so annoying to have the alarm go off and then have to wait 5 or 10 seconds through an annoying ad before I can shut that off. It especially sucks if you have someone else in the bed with you who gets up later. Yeah, the wife gets pissed off because it wakes her up completely. \"Sorry honey, just waot for the annoying ad with the jackhammer sound then go back to sleep.\" Yeah right. Silent ads are ok","Last couple of nights my alarm hasn't gone off, I've never had this problem and I've had the app for about 3 years. At first I thought I turned my alarm off but when I went into the app the app said my alarms were still on so I don't really know what the problem is. Maybe it is my fault when the problem is solved ill definitely give 5 stars, and I love the app alot better than the default alarm app","One big flaw with this app is that for whatever reason if YouTube is open, the alarm you have set will get turned off at some point. I like to sleep to audio; like rain or a video and this has caused me to be, in some real world cases; late (including today as I am writing this review!). If not for this weakness that literally defeats the point of having this app, I would rate higher because overall for it's ease of access and use.","Customer service was fast and good to work with. Still a great program. Thanks for all the help. Dean Love the program. I purchased it a while back and all was good until just recently. It now has ads. The problem is I have 3 Google accounts for different emails and it is looking at 1 that I didn't use to purchase it with. If I delete the account it shows paid. If I add it back it has ads. It didn't use to do this. Any help would be great.","very flexible alarm. Different alarms, many different ways to be woken.This is the only alarm that actually works well with Google. I use the solve the math expression way they provide.. I just wish the display wasn't so dark- its very slow to brighten up by sliding fingers up and down. Just wish there were a light theme or factory theme choice. Max brightness is what I want. Especially during the day .

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles. Will update my feedback as I continue using it"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.mapswithme.maps.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"The Survival Hunter Games 2","description":"The game comes fully loaded with amazing features!

It's easy to play and it doesn't really matter if you never get good at it. Challenges never really become too hard. Many are complaining about the ads but this game, in my opinion, has a very tolerable (and rewarding) ad scheme compared to other games out there. It's also amazing how the devs are still supporting this game. EDIT: I think it's better if the Potion count increased past 197, this gives more incentive to grind after maxing out.","Hello. I really wanted to write a review because this is fun. Because when my tablet is lagging, the zombies were just walking and there are no open roads. Ads is also popping up when the game has ended. Really fun game. I just hope that the mission is easier for children like me, and my little sister really hates that when the brains are collected starting to 11 or 12 it gets faster or gets more challenging. But for me, this game is challenging, really funny, entertaining and too many ads","Everything else is great; gameplay, graphics, controls. Ads aren't annoying in this game compared to others. I reduced it to one star is the fact I can't connect it with my Google Play account. I guess it is much better in saving progress than logging in with Facebook and I didn't used and logged in to my FB account IN YEARS. or atleast gave us [non-FB users] an option to save our progress through our Google Play account. Until then, I can give this review a worthy five stars. Thank you!","Great game! Super fun with amazing gameplay and cartoony graphics! I would give five stars but there is one thing that bothers me, when I try to watch ads to get five diamonds, it shows the ad, then doesn't give me any diamonds, or sometimes even takes some away! When this is fixed I will definitely give 5 stars! Awesome game nonetheless!","Hello Developers, the game is awesome already since 2013 and i play this game long time ago since my tablet is still working the features is Great Graphics, Easy Control, Great for low age like me, and of course its funny and challenging this game is old but Gold."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"net.mobigame.zombietsunami","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mobigame.zombietsunami&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"My Town : Police Station.

Only 30 seconds is too short, you can barely do anything with it. And on top of that, theres this huge watermark at the bottom of the screen that literally blocks 1/3 of the video. But I dont really care about the watermark, I just really hate how you can only do a 30 second video. Everything else is fine, but the time limit sucks. Please make it longer, atleast 5 minutes. I know you have to pay but thats just too short bruh","I think its amazing! I can make long slideshow that wont glitch and it's really easy-to-use. The reason I am giving it a 4 star is because I can't make the slides shorter and I would like it if there was more music, final reason it would be really nice if you could select more than one photo/video for the project overall it's really cool 😊","I decided to buy cute cuts $5.99 offer. I loved it... but a month later, the water mark sign popped up, again. Turns out it scammed me (it seems!) and removed my purchase. I did not spend my hard earned money on something that I only get 30 seconds of making a video that includes a watermark. I am very disapointed and will be complaining to the Cute Cut team. What happened to you Cute Cut? If you can fix it, I'm not even sure I want cute cut anymore. I might just ask for my money back. 💔"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mobivio.android.cutecut","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobivio.android.cutecut&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Jungle Animal Hair Salon - Styling Game for Kids","description":"The jungle animals got some funny hairstyles and want tropical makeovers.

However, you can't hear anything, so you can't hear any sounds or music, and on top of that, the text with Mike and Charlie won't load, this means you can't continue the game if you haven't done those things already, witch makes the game impossible to beat if you die, please fix this!","Omg it's amazing from the graphics to the puzzles 5 star 100% and you can play in ghost mode for free just turn your internet off I'm on my way to go download 3 and 4 and I'm sure they will be even better and for the little kids it's not even that scary at all and fairly easy to solve the puzzles if you cant solve them just watch an add giving you hints all in all this game is so amazing and I give it 5 star"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.keplerians.icescreamtwo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keplerians.icescreamtwo&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Weather Live","description":"Check the weather around you and all over the world at a glance.\r\nRely on the accurate weather forecast and adjust your schedule to the weather coming in.

Pretty accurate and the UI is very clean & easy to read. Love the widgets as you can adjust the transparency. Weather forecasts for different locations within a town makes it even better than other weather apps. Great job, devs!","Trying to like this on Android, but why does the font get smaller for the temp that is displayed in the status bar when temp gets triple digits? It's small enough to begin with, even noted your sample screenshots here on Play Store have the status bar temp 'magnified'. Can you make it more readable?","I had originally gave a 4 star due to the fact of issues with radar,but I have changed my rating to a 5 because of quick response from developer and the willingness to take suggestions on how to make app better.

Suscription is axed, this works worse than Google Play Music with an horrible UI. Furthermore it does not integrate into any streaming service and equipment for music outside those few chromecast ones. Quality in sound is well behind other services as well... Is sad to say that the mismanegement of products in Google as of now makes me very suspicious to drop my money on anything google from now on. Sad.","After so many years, can we have some basic playlist editing features like SELECTING MULTIPLE SONGS or SORTING?!?!?!??!!?!?!?!?! These features are so basic that users started asking for them since the start of this sorry excuse you call a product. And great job ignoring us for years. I hope you are proud of yourselves: you took away a perfectly adequate product that is Google Play Music and incompetently gave us this pathetic \"fancy\" replacement with a stupid AI suggesting horrible songs and no adequate functionality to build our own playlists. You should thank the oligopoly that I still allow your undeserving staff to make money off of me. I'm paying mostly to get rid of youtube ads.","Seldom works as promised. If you want to stream random songs this might be fine, but it DOES NOT WORK to play your own music as requested. Completely fails to shuffle playlists: plays the same songs, in the same order, over and over, every time. WARNING - if you use this service to upload your own music files you can NOT get them back, except as unlabeled zip files without folders; they gave me mine as 44 different 2gig files I had to download individually. Crazy! Display of titles is shockingly awful: it often can't fit the whole song title or band name, across various platforms. The inability to select more than one track at a time is absurd and makes manipulating Playlists extremely cumbersome. Works half as well as Pandora but insists on reverting to its own recommendations rather than the requested songs. Functionality with Android Auto is spotty as best: in the car I can't NOT shuffle a playlist, on the TV via AndoirdTV I can only play a playlist in exact order, and using voice commands to my speaker it can't shuffle. Paying for Google1 access to try and fix the bugs was completely pointless, an offensive waste of time and money (\"Have you tried resetting and reinstalling it?\" LOL great support). They kept promising it was going to get better and it just keeps working worse... I've been a Premium member and was a Google Music Play user since day one (and happily would have paid that fee forever!), but now I'm quitting because I'm paying them a monthly fee in order to NOT stream my own music. This has been a horrendous nightmare inflicted on me by those I trusted most with my precious music library, and I don't plan on letting them forget about their failure any time soon. The fact that so many users have been requesting the addition of a Sleep Time for so long-- and it goes ignored-- shows me they just don't care. Most frustrating of all, every single problem I've mentioned was non-existent on the Google Play Music planform before this awful \"upgrade.\" Music lovers should steer far clear of this app if you hope to control your own listening experience.","Just a redirect to YouTube itself, prioritises videos over music. Can't find a browse by album. You're better off using the YouTubeMusic app on your phone and casting to your TV than using this app. At least that way you can browse or find albums/songs/artists you want and control their playback. O, and no background playback, so unlike every other music player app on Android TV (Spotify, Pandora, etc), you can't exit this app and let it run in the background while, say, having your screen saver run. How can Google's own music app on its own platform be worse than third party apps? Or even worse than what they have done before with GPM?! Regression, not progression from Google:(","Terrible experience. Hard to find any content, and if you do get lucky enough to find some content/playlist one day - good luck finding it again on another day, as it seems like it randomly changes what playlists and content is available to you, except for a few of the exact same things that always show up"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.youtube.tvmusic","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube.tvmusic&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"WWE","description":"Download the WWE app for:\r\n- WWE news and announcements\r\n- The latest results from every pay-per-view, Raw, SmackDown and NXT\r\n- WWE Superstar profiles and title histories\r\n- Access to live event tickets and official WWE merchandise","descriptionHTML":"Download the WWE app for:<br>- WWE news and announcements<br>- The latest results from every pay-per-view, Raw, SmackDown and NXT<br>- WWE Superstar profiles and title histories<br>- Access to live event tickets and official WWE merchandise","summary":"Download the WWE app for the latest news, announcements, results and more!","installs":"10,000,000+","minInstalls":10000000,"maxInstalls":37855133,"score":4.487771,"scoreText":"4.5","ratings":787944,"reviews":228708,"histogram":{"1":58620,"2":14655,"3":27795,"4":69567,"5":617305},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$9.99 per item","size":"18M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"WWE, Inc.","developerId":"WWE,+Inc.","developerEmail":"appfeedback@wwe.com","developerWebsite":"https://www.wwe.com","developerAddress":"1241 E.
