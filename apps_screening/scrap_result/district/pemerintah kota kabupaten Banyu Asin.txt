A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"FM Radio","description":"Motorola FM Radio makes it easy to scan for stations, build your favorites list, set your sleep timer, record the best songs, and see live information about what’s playing -- all with a cool Material Design look. \r\n\r\nThis application has been designed to work on Motorola phones with an enabled FM chipset and running Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and above.

It will do the job but make you hate yourself for it. The interface is very heavy feeling and at times a pain to navigate. Its like trying to take a detour with no signs. They have catagories... sorta, but I am convinced it was just a program vomiting content after a night of cheap liquor. It has the vibe of a designed team that remember their assignment 3 hours before the deadline. Bring a GPS you're going to need it to find your way around.","More adds than video content. Often the videos fail, but don't worry the advertisements never do. If you try to rewatch a 10 second clip that recently failed, you'll have to watch the advertisement again, which never fails to run. Unacceptable for a company as large as it is, and owned by Disney. Get it together boys and girls....You should be better than this. I pay a monthly subscription for this, rediculous!","Incredibly terrible app for this size company. Load times are awful, there are 30 second unskippable commercials that freeze, so you wait 2 minutes to watch 25 seconds of content followed by more commercials. The watch app is terrible, I have espn+ membership but I'm unable to watch games that are on broadcast television like ABC, because I don't have a cable membership. Their watch section is laid out terribly and it's vague what you are able to watch with your membership. So bad.","If it weren't a dang monopoly, I would've deleted this app years ago. Slow load times, has no problem loading 40 second ads, but then won't load the 10 second highlight you came to see. But wait, try to find the highlight anywhere else, and it'll kick you back to their app. Please, for the love of God, can yahoo, or fox sports, or literally anyone make a half decent app for sports. I'll take it over this dumpster fire any day","Horrible lag in the app. Also it does a horrendous job playing videos. The big issue is the handoff from ad to content. And even when the video is playing, of you change the time on the video, it won't respond and will skip the video. Would have expected a lot more from a big company, bit the app has bee.

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much! Saying that the local news I receive is great and helps keep me up-to-date!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.particlenews.newsbreak","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.particlenews.newsbreak&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"TuneIn Radio: News, Sports & Online Music Stations","description":"FROM NOW ON, THIS IS RADIO.\r\n\r\nTuneIn brings together live news, sports, music, podcasts and radio stations from around the world.\r\n\r\nWith live and on-demand audio from the voices you trust, on any device, you're never without something amazing to listen to.\r\n\r\nALL YOUR AUDIO IN ONE APP.\r\n\r\n• News: Listen to and stay informed with live 24/7 news from local, national and global news sources, including CNBC, CNN, MSNBC, FOX News Radio, NPR and BBC.\r\n\r\n• Sports:  Listen to live NFL, NHL, and college games, anywhere you go, plus local, national, and global sports talk stations.

Very, very very annoying when I'm listening to a live sports game! Please stop being so greedy and fix this issue! Put like a 5 minute grace period in or something reasonable.","Enjoy this application for many years now. However, recently I am having issues with the sleep timer on my favorite radio station. Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","It's a good app, you can access 1000s of stations but one of the joys that made it similar to listening to a real live radio was the sleep timer feature. It's not working on the current version for some reason which is a shame and a pain. Not an issue if listening during the day, I would imagine though.","App often goes into endless cycle of ads and doesn't return to radio station I'm listening to. I understand having ads when I'm not paying for subscription but I just listened to 20 minutes of ads and had to turn off because it won't return to radio station I was listening to. Have to close, reopen, listen to more ads then back to station. And then when radio station returns from its own commercial break TuneIn will suddenly cut to its own ads & begins endless cycle of ads w/o return to station."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"tunein.player","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Wikipedia","description":"The best Wikipedia experience on your Mobile device.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth!

Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building.

Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

This app is amazing... but the issue is. On my galaxy A11, the app works smoothly when I open the app, then after a few minutes staying on the app it starts to lag. When it gets really bad it either locks up my phone, black screen, and or the app closing out by itself... I want to enjoy the full experience of the app because I love to explore.

Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.)

The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles. Will update my feedback as I continue using it"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.mapswithme.maps.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en&gl=us"}]
