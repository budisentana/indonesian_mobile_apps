There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard.

I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages.

Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this?

The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes.

And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","I mostly do the single player offline, and it's pretty fun and entertaining at first.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect.

It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask?

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth! Had huge glitch on my game play, took a couple of weeks to fix, they got it done!!! Thank you all. Awesome job well done. Totally locked in forever. 👍👍 Once again the Tech Team has stepped up to Excellence. Thanks 😊 7.21.21","Fantastic idea ! 2 stars missing because this game does not load properly. Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game.

It is much more than your average city simulator or one of the tycoon games.

If you’re starting to think that there are things beyond farming, put your farm sim on hold and start building your town that will gradually become a city, and then a megapolis with the best airport in the world! We know how plane games can become repetitive over time, so we are constantly improving this city simulator, to ensure that our players are always engaged, both on the ground and in the air.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to try out the role of an air tycoon or an airline commander, you’ll find something to love about Airport City. \r\n\r\nBuild a modern international-class terminal to send an airplane to whichever corner of the world you want. Just get your aircraft in the air and land them in any destination, from a faraway town to a shining megapolis. To make your travels memorable, you can bring back rare artifacts and unique collections. See how many souvenirs can fit in one aircraft!\r\nBut it’s not just a flight simulator—you’ll have to apply your outstanding management skills to develop all the supporting infrastructure too, in one of the most amazing airport games! Take care of the entire city next to it, to provide your airport all the required services.\r\n\r\nIf what you’re looking for in city building games is peaceful gameplay and interactions, this city simulator is exactly what you need. Here you start from a small town and develop it into a great megapolis!\r\nYou can create alliances with other players to complete joint quests and participate in competitions. Just find a fellow airline commander from a neighboring city and make your gaming experience twice as much fun!

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Blocky Cars: tank wars & robot games","description":"Welcome to the creative pixel car & tank world of Blocky Cars!\r\nWhat’s this online game about?

There are 2 modes, system smash and planet smash. Planet smash has a large variety of things to destroy planets with, and you can create your own planets. System smash only has a few weapons, and its like universe sandbox in a way. A few things I would like to see, are a bit more weapons in the system smash, and a bit more realistic things, like if you melt the polar ice caps the world will flood. Once that is done, this is a 5 star game","It's good, but the 1 thing that really annoye me is I have tried getting the Cube World with the orange laser and the grid, but even though I make the best cube. I don't unlock it. So can you guys please fix it! I think other people around the world are suffering from it and are sad and mad. Its a really satisfying game it never gets you bored.","A fantastic and amazing game. Can't wait to see what other tools you guys come out with. Edit: One of the recent updates made the game not recognize my remove adverts purchase, and it doesn't allow me to make the purchase again. Hope this is fixed some point soon. Solar Smash is still great. Edit edit: Reinstalling seems to have helped. Nevermind.","Have had paid version for a little while, and enjoyed it a lot. But, now with the 3 new weapons, WOW! a LOT better. All 3 are entertaining as all get out. Highly recommend. NOTE: Even tho have paid version, after update (8/2/2021) I had a full screen ad show up. WHAT GIVES??","Extremely realistic graphics, a lot of planets, the new solar system mode is fun, you can modify the damage of some of the weapons, and.. it's a game to play in free time like 30 minutes.

Very one dimensional.

As a WWE lifer, I am extremely disappointed. Original Review: ***** - Wonderful app PPVs (new and old) for decades of classic WWF/E, WCW+ content to be found, rarely seen behind the scenes stuff, comedies, documentaries, & of course, pretty much every show & PPV from yesteryear to now.","I will give you a 5 star rating if you either break ties with peacock tv or fix all their issues they are horrible its always buffering can barely watch it, can't rewind or start over from the beginning everything sucks about peacock tv and when you call them out on all their issues they blame your internet well I know its not my internet and if its not that then hum I wonder what the issue is!!","Need to be able to download matches to view off-line. Want ability to search for * vs * rather than having to know the specific ppv Be intuitive rather than pushing specific stars - I Don't Care about Cena, Oldberg or Slowman Stainz AT ALL!","It was working fine on my phone and box but now I can't sign in on them unless it's my roku tv box but I have to wait a week before I see the previous wk nxt which isn't right at all fix it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.wwe.universe","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wwe.universe&hl=en&gl=us"}]
