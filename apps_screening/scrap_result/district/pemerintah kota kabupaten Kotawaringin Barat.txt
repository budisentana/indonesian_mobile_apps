Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bapokting Kobar","description":"Aplikasi Barang Pokok dan Barang Penting Kabupaten Kotawaringin Barat (Bapokting Kobar) menampilkan informasi harga barang pokok dan barang penting di wilayah Kabupaten Kotawaringin Barat yang dikelola oleh Dinas Perindustrian, Perdagangan, Koperasi, Usaha Kecil dan Menengah Kabupaten Kotawaringin Barat.\r\n\r\nInformasi perkembangan harga barang pokok dan barang penting yang ditampilkan adalah yang berlaku di pasar-pasar yang berada di wilayah Kabupaten Kotawaringin Barat.

Is it so complicated to have a big button to just turn off the voice assist that to me is as annoying a Karen telling what to do?","It has changed a lot since I used it in the passed, less intuitive. Obviously need to read the manual and then re-review.","The app can take 2 or three tries to fully function in Android Auto. That's a problem. Also it does not matter what channel or volume you set in the app the voice engine will cut out source audio. You can have the voice or you can have silence but you can't navigate to a point and listen to anything without interruption. Unless there is a solution the developer will not share this app is not ready for Primetime.","Closing the app in system task manager caused that all my saved routes GONE! Same thing with blocked roads edited by myself. All gone. Need to fix this or set a reminder for users that they always have to close the app proper using 'Exit', not just killing it in task manager. BTW. 'average speed' panel doesn't work.","Maps not bad (OSM); interface/search atrocious. Example: asks for country; type United it prompts with Kingdom, back up, type States - frowny face. Must type name of state, which isn't a country. When you get a possibility there is no \"show on map\" except in various unfathomable contexts. Getting beyond Last Search takes gymnastics and a few MAJOR shopping centers in my area not in database. So, free, navigation OK, UI big flunk. Needs real user input + UI/workflow redesign.

Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"India News, Latest News App, Live News Headlines","description":"NewsPoint is a news app that presents the latest news in crisp format from trusted national and international publishers.

It has minor issues of real time. Street view doesn't always work, even after I previously did a street view of that location. This app would be perfect if I could program my own route. I'm an escort (Pilot car) for oversize loads. We have routes issued to us by the states and counties. Plus, sometimes I don't like the route, google maps offers. One last thing, I wish we could switch to satellite view AFTER we hit \"start\". Thank you!","For quite a while I couldn't get voiced notifications. So, I decided to \"Google\" it. It said, delete cache and data. It seemed to work fine. I have just done an 8.5 hour journey that should have taken 5.5 hours. No fault of Google obviously. However, 3/4 of the way through the trip, the notifications stopped. Then 30 minutes before our journey end the voiced notifications packed up. If this does not alter I'll try 'Waze', it looks a much better option.","Never uses the most direct or fastest route. I entered my destination and it said it would take 1 hour and 40 minutes on the fastest of the 3 options of routes it gave me, which I knew was way off. I used another navigation app and reached my destination in 50 minutes. Other times it has taken me off the beaten path in an unfamiliar city and through some very bad neighborhoods when I could have stayed on the interstate and reached my destination much, much faster and safer. Do not recommend.","This application is always inaccurate with time tracking. It also makes serious errors which make the driver lost. It also makes it hard to see future directions. When it does a good job it is excellent but when it doesn't it is highly frustrating. The app made a mistake and said Jefferson hwy was Jefferson heights and kept sending me to the wrong location. It also gets lost in the French quarter. It is frustrating and can cause loss of employment and lost time in one's life.","Maps has not been working properly for me for the past month! It won't load the map and when getting directions, it wants me to take the longest, most ridiculous route to get to my destination. It also loses signal often and gets lost, or will tell me to turn at the very last minute causing me to miss turns.

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles.

Very, very very annoying when I'm listening to a live sports game! Please stop being so greedy and fix this issue!

Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","It's a good app, you can access 1000s of stations but one of the joys that made it similar to listening to a real live radio was the sleep timer feature. It's not working on the current version for some reason which is a shame and a pain. Not an issue if listening during the day, I would imagine though.","App often goes into endless cycle of ads and doesn't return to radio station I'm listening to. I understand having ads when I'm not paying for subscription but I just listened to 20 minutes of ads and had to turn off because it won't return to radio station I was listening to. Have to close, reopen, listen to more ads then back to station. And then when radio station returns from its own commercial break TuneIn will suddenly cut to its own ads & begins endless cycle of ads w/o return to station."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"tunein.player","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Mobile Strike","description":"Become an action hero like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the new game of modern war -  Mobile Strike!

It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week.

That is not enough time, and to automatically start charging your Google Play account, I thought this app had a free version. I can't get to the free version. What ever happened to \"try before you buy? Edit: OK, it is possible to kill both\" free trial offer\" screens and try the app, just a lot of ads. I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate. A free trial means you don't need to do anything to use it, including making an effort to subscribe. UPD: sorry, my bad. Didn't notice the X button.

I love fishing irl but some fish I can't catch irl but this game allows me to a Catch fish that I probably will never catch irl . But it does give you Joy","The gold crest has defeated me, I just feel I have paid for something I can't complete and feel a bit let down. I've failed over 50 times now and it's cost me too much time and game cash, I'm completely deflated now. It's so frustrating because it's something I paid for so it should be easier to complete but no, it's just sucking the life out of the game.

Salt or fresh water, etc....","Amazing game n I don't mind adjusting my review to 4 stars from 1 since I noticed that now sum notifications can be quickly skipped during game play but I would luv to give you 5 stars instead if you can make it so that I can skip other notifications too like after catching a fish it tells me other player's scores and what crafting materials were acquired etc. Stuff like this really gets in the way when you just want to fish nonstop with no interruptions.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much! Saying that the local news I receive is great and helps keep me up-to-date!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.particlenews.newsbreak","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.particlenews.newsbreak&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Baby Panda Home Safety","description":"Home is a special place.
