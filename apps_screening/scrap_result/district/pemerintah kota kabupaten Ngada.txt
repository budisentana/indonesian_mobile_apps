But now it doesn't track my family members moving. Clearly they are not with me but it shows its home with me. But there is nothing wrong with the data and location. They are both on yet it doesn't track. Thinking of finding another GPS tracker since this been failing a couple of times.","Easy to use. Accurate. Can give a street view even as to where your loved one might be. Makes me feel more secure that family can see where I am at.","Works great on rare occasions might not be accurate by a block, but if it's a common place u should be fine. Phones must be on to locate .","This app would have been rated 4, EXCEPT they are now killing computer browser access, consequently the 1 star rating. How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home. So, instead of just opening the tracker in another browser tab, the developers in their infinite wisdom have decided that it is better if you unlock your phone, open the app, and then be able to locate. What a DUMB decision :-( PLEASE rethink this!","Great for finding lost phones and keeping an eye on loved ones.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. üòê","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"HTC Account‚ÄîServices Sign-in","description":"With HTC Account, sign in to multiple HTC services in one place on your phone.

I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a üîê screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much!

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"iHeart: Radio, Music, Podcasts","description":"Your Music, Your Stations, And #1 For Podcasts.

You can't search within a podcast so you have to scroll until you find the one you want and since they are ordered from new to old, if you let it play automatically, it'll play \"in reverse\" (i.e. Part 2 would play before Part 1.) and every now and then, instead of staying the next episode, it'll go back to the top and play the latest.","When it works nothing beats it but lately it is worst than Sirus.....which is bad. Cuts out every half song...then I wait about 5 minutes and some times it comes back but mostly I need to stop the song and restart it. Very frustrating when trying to get a tan on a beach. The web site on the computer is #1.... but the app for the phone is a big ZERO.","I totally love this app!!! It works good, but there are two problems with it. There are too many ads and also I also had trouble for some time keeping the Bluetooth connection when I open the app and play a radio station or podcast or anything on the app. I know there is nothing wrong with me Bluetooth speaker. My speakers are fully charged and I can play everything else on it. Can you please look into it?","I used to enjoy this app more in the beginning but now not so much. I could add and delete songs and it would only play the songs I added. Now you can't delete any songs and it plays random songs not added by me. Also you can't add any Garth Brooks songs. I even tried the free trial for premium and still no luck. I tried to listen to Garth Brooks radio with unlimited skips and I heard one song from him and skipped over 50 times and nothing. I am currently looking into other music options.","Commercials, Commercials, Commercials! If you like Commercials, then this is the app for you. Every time I use the app, I have to FIRST LISTEN TO FIFTEEN COMMERCIALS before I actually get to the station. I upgraded to the plus service, but to no avail.

I love it, but I hate that most of the good options use gems. Not every story makes you use gems though. If you have money to spare, you can pick all the good options. Gems are pretty cheap too, but they're easily used up quick. It kinda reminds me of wattpad, but with visuals and you get to make choices to guide your character. Download it!! It's fun! And very intriguing.. Of course if you download and come not to like it, you can always undownload it.","The stories are interesting and hilarious, which is the reason I installed this game in the first place. However, the entire gem system is ridiculous!! You get one gem after completing a chapter, which isn't as great considering most decent choices available hold the price of about 14 to 29 gems, moreover you get multiple choices per chapter, in addition to the tickets which allow you to read the story in the first place. Some people aren't capable of PAYING to play, so please help their case.","This game is really good üëç I really recommend it it's a nice thing to use when u fell like watching a movie or something but it's way better because you get to choose what happens! Some choices are premium if they're really good or special,to get them you need gems,you get gems at every end of a chapter, and the only thing that some users mightn't like is that you have to watch an ad, also at the end of every chapter, I hope you enjoy the game!ü§óps.this game is soooooo good! (Lol)","It is a good game. The only thing im not a fan of is the fact that in order to do the exciting options yoi have to spend real money. But other than that i would say that this game is so, so, so much fun to play. Highly reccomend this game. I honestly could not imagine my life WITHOUT Episode. But back to the diamonds situation... I feel like the options should be free. In some games it will give you the option to \"go for a night out with your friends\" and i have to \"stay home and do chores\"","I hate how you have to buy so many gems to get make \"good choices\" and it's really hard to get gems. Also I'm on mobile and it won't let me make a story from the app, it keeps taking me to episode interactive like a computer. I don't know why it does this, but If anyone does or they know how to help, please respond. And episode, change the gem situation then my rating will be a 5 stars."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.episodeinteractive.android.catalog","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.episodeinteractive.android.catalog&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"WWE","description":"Download the WWE app for:\r\n- WWE news and announcements\r\n- The latest results from every pay-per-view, Raw, SmackDown and NXT\r\n- WWE Superstar profiles and title histories\r\n- Access to live event tickets and official WWE merchandise","descriptionHTML":"Download the WWE app for:<br>- WWE news and announcements<br>- The latest results from every pay-per-view, Raw, SmackDown and NXT<br>- WWE Superstar profiles and title histories<br>- Access to live event tickets and official WWE merchandise","summary":"Download the WWE app for the latest news, announcements, results and more!","installs":"10,000,000+","minInstalls":10000000,"maxInstalls":37855133,"score":4.487771,"scoreText":"4.5","ratings":787944,"reviews":228708,"histogram":{"1":58620,"2":14655,"3":27795,"4":69567,"5":617305},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$9.99 per item","size":"18M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"WWE, Inc.","developerId":"WWE,+Inc.","developerEmail":"appfeedback@wwe.com","developerWebsite":"https://www.wwe.com","developerAddress":"1241 E.

As a WWE lifer, I am extremely disappointed.

This app is amazing... but the issue is. On my galaxy A11, the app works smoothly when I open the app, then after a few minutes staying on the app it starts to lag. When it gets really bad it either locks up my phone, black screen, and or the app closing out by itself... I want to enjoy the full experience of the app because I love to explore. Thank you.","Typing in the search box was impossible. Letters were erasing themselves as I was typing. I updated my Gboard. The same thing happened. Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. üôÇ Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.) Also a really useful feature would be a wildfire layer in Voyager. Thanks."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.earth","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.earth&hl=en&gl=us"}]
