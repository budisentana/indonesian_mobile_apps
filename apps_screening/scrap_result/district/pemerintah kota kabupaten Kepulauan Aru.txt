I could search songs, nothing glitched, it was amazing. But eventually, I wasn't and still aren't able to search songs. The first page it opens when you click on the app, says that the service is offline. And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Smashy Road: Wanted","description":"SMASHY ROAD: WANTED\r\n\r\nYou are WANTED!

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn‚Äôt start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement.

Fix this please!","for an expensive game, your staff sure have little care for fixing simple bugs. or is it intentional that you refrain players from watching ads, so they will purchase overpriced game currency? we pay with our time for viewing them, have some decency. frankly, all you have left is good item designs. even the new boss raid requires money to get the nicer prizes. when I said listen to your players for once, I didn't mean to give them more things to SPEND REAL MONEY ON.","There are aspects of this game that I enjoy like decorating rooms and fashion. Then there are things I could do without out. Like having a gotcha taken from me x2 and all the occult makes me want to leave the game.","Listen to your players for once. Like another review said, LP has potential. And in my opinion is the most aesthetically pleasing avatar chat game in the app store. Reason why I've stayed for so long. But that alone won't keep people coming back. It gets boring. Because it seems like an endless spiral of spend money, get new cute outfits and repeat. Needs more games and square events. Reasons for more play time. And I'm not taking about Treasure World, that's nothing but a cash grab.","I love the game it's cute but it doesn't let me watch ads to get free rewards?

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate.

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly.

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles. Will update my feedback as I continue using it"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.mapswithme.maps.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Puzzle Game","description":"This is the most interesting block game you have ever held in your hands!\r\nIt gets all the charm of the puzzle game: simple, fun, attractive and suitable to everybody.\r\nIt is also the funniest way to train your brain and keep your mind sharp!\r\n\r\n>How to play?\r\nPlace the pieces into board.
