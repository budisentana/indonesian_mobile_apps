There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

I listed myself in the top 5% but did not get any rewards. Even after waiting for 48 hours, I received no rewards. If this happens on continual basis, I will definitely lose my interest and likewise many more...","This is an incredible game that I just can't get away from. It's not like other games where you are forced to watch ads to do anything, so that's a huge plus. I can never get bored of this game and I'm in love with the character designs and the graphics and everything about it. There is a power system, stopping you from playing for hours and hours, but I like it because then I can get out and do things, instead of being a couch potato. Thanks for creating such an amazing, fun, game!","The Game is well designed in appearing the smallest deatails of each character, however each variant of the charter all ways has the same special 1 and 3, to make it appealing and interesting you could change the super speacial to something a little different to other character. The survivor mode is fun but the wheel of fortune is not balanced in terms of probability, i tend to get more crystals then any other prize on the wheel. But over all its a whell designed game.","This game is epic I love how it is offline because all offline games are soo boring unlike this one. I think there needs to be an update and include more player though. On my tablet this game is perfect but on my phone for some reason after I've played a battle it goes off the game and into my home screen so I never get my XP and have to do the fight again but it still takes my energy bars and the process repeats so I dont move on. Please help me fix this","I have been playing this game for queit some time now and i really do like but there are some issues in the game that really need to be fixed. First of all in the online battle when i ranked in the top 20 i didnt recive any reward..... I waited for quiet some time but still did not recieve anything. The next thing is that sometimes i dont get daily logim rewards.Add some updates in this game like Being able to send stuff of tours to friends, multiplayer mode to play with people of your choosing."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.wb.goog.injustice","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.injustice&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Go: A lighter, faster way to search","description":"Google Go is a lighter, faster way to search, with search results optimised to save up to 40% data.\r\n\r\nGet answers quickly and reliably with Google Go, even on slow connections and smartphones with low space.

I think it deserves 5 stars but I have an issue. It is a bit different from Google, not just talking about its visuals. When I want to open a site from photos, it doesn't have a option. When we click on people also search for, we start getting more similar questions but it doesn't provide that. But since I needed it, I tried to install Google but it always says I can't because I have a similar app. I need you to do something about it. Beside that, it is totally awesome!","I use this because it's not as bloated as google, but there's some really stupid features. Like the fact it keeps telling me that I made an illegal request by modifying my search. Or how when I'm browsing links from the search results, it suddenly has connection issues and hangs, or how about giving users the ability to shut off lite mode? And finally, the home button is in the worst possible place for a tablet because I often accidentally hit the button when I set my tablet down every time!!!!","Keeps popping up a box saying Google lite is ready even though I have it turned off, super irritating, also don't like the auto word fixing during search, leaving me to go back and make changes while it leaves actual misspelled words in the search but changes the words that I made sure to be entered exactly as they need to be to find that info. I avoid it unless I need to use the saved log in info. Plus it has a constant feed that can't be stopped, if you touch anywhere it goes there","Far out one of my best I always prefer google is really awesome for some reason I feel good having and dealing google apps well that's me . Just makes me feel like we're on same frequency's and that's exactly why I'm satisfied even though trying other apps. I end up on same place. so don't get me wrong the mayority off times it has being a tremendously learning Exp. Nevertheless I find my self more. comfortable with google. and you might say I'm a freak not at All I'm Loyal. It's how I operate.","A little notification box pops up that says Google lite is ready now. It forces you to use it, even though the information you wanted already came up. It will continue to loop like this if you continue to search for more things.If you do select Google lite, it starts the search over from the beginning, despite the progress you have made.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features.

Add new robots to your roster from various offer packs and take them to entertaining bouts to come back as champions!","comments":["Overall, this is a good game. But, I bought a bunch of stuff on my iPhone, and logged into Facebook hoping to transfer my games data over to my Android phone, only it find out that none of it transfers across phones, but I can still log into Facebook. This is a little more than anoying, and if there's a way to fix the problem, this is an easy 5 star game.","Great game! Best part is that you dont have to upgrade your bot really to beat the boss, maybe just one or two. Also, no need to really purchase anything, just do good combos. The only bad thing is that you have to get google play so if you delete it you dont have any progress, make sure you save the progress!! To help you if you have trouble winning, purchase these robots: UWI Ambush UWII Six Shooter WRB I Gridlock WRB Albino WRB- Metro Gold","I'll start by saying that a few days ago this would've been 4 starts as it's a fun game but the energy system slows it down. Today I got on and the game told me I hadn't beaten UWI yet? How? I have two WRBII robots and I was getting ready to fight Zues. So I though eh whatever I'll play through it really quick. So I equipped my old UWI robot and tried to go through the championship again. I beat UWI logged on the next day and the progress was gone once again. I still have all my robots and stuf","Good game, but way to many notifications. Also, cosmobot is way to difficult to beat. I mean it feels like it goes from 0-100. Good graphics and fun robots. Also the prices are way overpriced. 25 bucks for 200,000 coins? But overall its a pretty good game with nice mechanics.","Just wanted to say I lost my full account after 2 plus years of playing non stop. I had it for over 4 and a half but quit playing then load on with a new phone concected to my Facebook and it says \"active device\" even though my old phone is broken and usable. I used to play this with my friend who passed and finally got back on and it doesn't work. It's kinda sad that I can't connect with Facebook because I was 12 when I made my account and don't know my name.

The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!! And for the RICHIE RICH PEOPLE out there that loves to spend $$$$$ then go play Mobile Strike Gaming and you'll feel right at Home then tooo!!!!

I love the concept of being able to customize I've played this game for years and I've been on and off with it. I had the game downloaded about two years ago and had no problems. But now in 2021 whenever I try to play the game freezes and I cant do anything except the info button and once I restart it, it says my profile has been banned for unauthorized activity even tho I havent played the game in years. Plz help😐","It's a good game, the reason why I'm giving this a 3-star is because I have a lot of problem since I was playing this game, sometimes when I fight the enemies once I drop their hp to 0, they still stay alive, and my other problem is it's hard to get rewards, I would suggest increasing the drop rate after winning the game, my third problem is the energy cores, it takes too long to recharge them back again, that's all.","Good game all around and though I do prefer the original version for sure this is quite the upgrade in terms of origins for the bot, also while I do find some of the items can be extremely expensive there are often ways to counteract this such as with the upgrading parts to silver gold etc: the solution I found was to do sparring matches on pro every time I got 5 energy cores until I had enough cash. This is still an amazing game, thanks alot","Really enjoyed playing this game... Loved the ability to make your own robot from a wide range of parts, moves and designs. Just one thing though, when my screen doesn't show attack effects, like the sparks and hit effects, does it have to do with my phone or the fact that it is an android one?","I love this game but it is a little hard the the beginning the ai is tough and you can only fo five fights until it recharges but once you reach pvp it gets a lot easier cause you get things called cores for robots and another currence and you can sometimes get enough cores to get an elemental part which is only like 150 cores which are not hard to get."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.reliancegames.rschampions","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reliancegames.rschampions&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ice Age Village","description":"Embark on a fun and frozen journey through the Ice Age universe.

I'm now waiting a month at a time to simply expand my village and that's all I CAN do. I can't buy anything, no room, and if I do I have to wait another 2 weeks to expand so, great game but it gets exhausting waiting to expand all the time because it is so so so so expensive. Would b 5 stars if it weren't for that.","Hi I'm Giving this a two star 🌟 only because now when I play in collecting my coins and stuff and doing what I have to do to level up but once in a few minutes maybe seconds I get ads It will stop and then give me another one and it's just not worth the hassle for me so please explain why I'm getting ads? Or does anyone else gets ads great game I love it just the ads are annoying","Amazing game, but a little bit expensive. Anyways, the only improvement I need is that I want the things I buy to already have their permanent places because moving them is a hassle and I do not like unorganized things so...😬","it's a money pit after around 50 90% of animals you have to use acorns which you have to buy. you only have about 12 toys for the critters to play, decoration is not much better, I think once you buy in the VIP club you get more animals and decorating and toys. all they want is more money . It stopped giving the free acorns. And I lost my game and cannot find it so I had to start over.","I've always loved the game but the constant asking to update with another game found on the cloud is so annoying as it takes you some levels back. I keep selecting no and to update my current level as the main one but the question keeps appearing."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftIAHM","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftIAHM&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Baby Panda Home Safety","description":"Home is a special place.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much! Saying that the local news I receive is great and helps keep me up-to-date!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.particlenews.newsbreak","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.particlenews.newsbreak&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Siminaksopal Trenggalek","description":"SIMINAKSOPAL ( Sistem Informasi Administrasi Kependudukan Secara Online Paket Lengkap )\r\n\r\nPelayanan secara online pengurusan dokumen administrasi kependudukan ( Kartu Keluarga, KTP-el, Pindah Datang, Pindah Keluar, KIA, Akta Kelahiran, Akta Kematian, Update data dan pelayanan lainnya ) oleh Dinas Kependudukan Dan Pencatatan Sipil Kabupaten Trenggalek bagi penduduk Kabupaten Trenggalek.\r\n\r\nDinas Kependudukan dan Pencatatan Sipil Kabupaten Trenggalek\r\n\r\n#GISA\r\n#MembahagiakanMasyarakat\r\n#DisdukcapilTrenggalek","descriptionHTML":"SIMINAKSOPAL ( Sistem Informasi Administrasi Kependudukan Secara Online Paket Lengkap )<br><br>Pelayanan secara online pengurusan dokumen administrasi kependudukan ( Kartu Keluarga, KTP-el, Pindah Datang, Pindah Keluar, KIA, Akta Kelahiran, Akta Kematian, Update data dan pelayanan lainnya ) oleh Dinas Kependudukan Dan Pencatatan Sipil Kabupaten Trenggalek bagi penduduk Kabupaten Trenggalek.<br><br>Dinas Kependudukan dan Pencatatan Sipil Kabupaten Trenggalek<br><br>#GISA<br>#MembahagiakanMasyarakat<br>#DisdukcapilTrenggalek","summary":"Complete Online Population Administration Information System","installs":"1,000+","minInstalls":1000,"maxInstalls":2128,"score":4.2380953,"scoreText":"4.2","ratings":21,"reviews":17,"histogram":{"1":3,"2":0,"3":2,"4":0,"5":16},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"3.0M","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4 and up","developer":"disdukcapil trenggalek","developerId":"disdukcapil+trenggalek","developerEmail":"disdukcapil.trenggalek@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"https://dukcapil.trenggalekkab.go.id","privacyPolicy":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aSvTg8yHA96dKEL3pE4WM-YwgX-H1iBTw_jx_3beVck/edit?usp=sharing","developerInternalID":"4618468527496977610","genre":"Productivity","genreId":"PRODUCTIVITY","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZMzOind1XNqRR8upqMs8TID79_QBOHJ1-7xP5Zy5_R8YgoIcGyWERO216E6Qadz4Pw","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nquNV9n-may9i8OtvF4bpFknjCWTkcr3sxHvu1bqXzIS1BgJuNL1wgkfKmdFGahliY0","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cZUXZ95rBb2KpExUp0YYE9VH0z7fxnacucFNFIwvNBDtjHHvRNhRS-CKCAG2-czmr58","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qZC7rpdlTINk83WTRFuGqPEirqrTAI-8JyENfLcrYWUUXVWvh4LPiR1dciFYZT3tZFA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QJNpUE03NaPHQRoAIyQwzuCbmWhS8YiCY2pS3UmitB97euHOEwhqLrnfF46DRLgm8A","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kjEGLG5h8d_He_uHxLuB1JgFMCUut1Iy3q1BtX750cZDUB0-ai4Rcy7LD0BHSVw219s","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zQNrcePvxgJOVMdiN6lJUnb-fBQI7IiAKHqv8iQR452IM6JtzQNdj-vZtaTdvLxQQ3Q","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ido09qt3Iki5Ln-_CSRJsKZBs5g0IBTOReYD5omD-wwJkdhKtjxatPt8pVaGDHjt5gw"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-PFtBcLY37g?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","videoImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nquNV9n-may9i8OtvF4bpFknjCWTkcr3sxHvu1bqXzIS1BgJuNL1wgkfKmdFGahliY0","contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Apr 27, 2021","updated":1619525635000,"version":"1.03","recentChanges":"Rilis Pertama","comments":[],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"id.go.trenggalekkab.siminaksopal","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.go.trenggalekkab.siminaksopal&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google News - Top world & local news headlines","description":"Google News is a personalized news aggregator that organizes and highlights what’s happening in the world so you can discover more about the stories that matter to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nStay up to date on your interests\r\n\r\n• The For You tab delivers the top stories across all your favorite topics and sources in one place.

That is not enough time, and to automatically start charging your Google Play account, I thought this app had a free version. I can't get to the free version. What ever happened to \"try before you buy? Edit: OK, it is possible to kill both\" free trial offer\" screens and try the app, just a lot of ads. I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate. A free trial means you don't need to do anything to use it, including making an effort to subscribe. UPD: sorry, my bad. Didn't notice the X button.

When i choose a form, for some reason it doesnt show the one that i picked. This only happens sometimes but it always bothers me and gets me killed on matches especially boss matches. Please fix this as soon as possible, because i cant really play properly with this problem in the way. Please dev's find a way to fix this, cause i cant play properly...","It's nice game 🎮 and also like real it feels like enemys in our home but when fighting with enemy and energy is over then Ben ten only moves his hand hard levels not all the alien but small Ben has that only alien are there in this game nice game and it is ar and also has a camera which changes us into alien I m happy with this","Yes I love this game so much that I wanna play this for ages . Just there must be a more no. long range attack and a special long range attack and some alien must have a long range and short range attack also but this game is fun . I would like to play a game with a alien expilerince . Just add omni kix powers now but no matter what omni enhanced power is also good and add many aliens . This game is good and keep it up ☺️☺️ . Just add more achivemenys also so that we can level up in google play","Graphics are good , but aiming and attacking are bad. Aiming is not good , and there are less levels in this game","This game is very awesome because the AR version of this game is very good and the stingfly are very cool. The stingfly hits her opponents when they are looking opposit site. I like the game very much so i rate 5 stars on the game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.heliosinteractive.ben10","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heliosinteractive.ben10&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"MAPS.ME – Offline maps, travel guides & navigation","description":"Fast, detailed and entirely offline maps with turn-by-turn navigation – trusted by over 140 million travelers worldwide.\r\n\r\nOFFLINE MAPS\r\nSave mobile data, no internet is required.\r\n\r\nNAVIGATION\r\nUse driving, walking and cycle navigation anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL GUIDES\r\nSave you time planning the trip and never miss an interesting place with our ready-made travel guides.

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles. Will update my feedback as I continue using it"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.mapswithme.maps.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en&gl=us"}]
