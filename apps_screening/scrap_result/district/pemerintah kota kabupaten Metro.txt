The arrival/ departure times for CTA trains could be a bit clearer. Think Ventra app. Has a comprehensive selection of bus and rail routes but the time displays are difficult to understand. Having a list of departure / arrival times would help tremendously. All in all a good transit reference app and I like it. I'll give it more stars when I get used to it.","This is a good app, but resent update that brought ads just horrible. Ads that jump at me right when I press the button to start a bus ride, when I need to scan a QR code on the bus station and get in the bus I get a full screen pop up. Your decision just forced me to move to other app. Good luck with this. I was loyal user but for now I am out.","The app can be very helpful, but arrival times can be a bit off which can be annoying if you don't plan around it. Another big problem I have with the app is that it's downright unusable when in dark mode. Many elements of the UI don't properly transition to a brighter color when in dark mode and are unreadable, and switching back to light mode is annoying. All and all I would say the app is a4/5 on light mode and a 1/5 on dark mode","I've enjoyed this app for years over my local government's attempt at an app, but the advertisements have become a problem. When it's crunch time and you need to check on buses with a sense of urgency, having a full page ad (usually of another map app?? WHY??) that has to load, then be exited, has actually screwed me several times.","So confusing to look at all I want to do is search for and find out a bus time, it's just far too fussy,. Update Developer response saying this is in the lines tab. How would I be expected to know that? . I am looking for a bus time / route. I know nothing about bus lines and which services they operate.

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

I am writing this review without a biased towards the reboot, although I prefer the original. In no way does this app fulfill the fun of AR the way it should. The tracking is horrible and the mini games are mediocre.

Works best outside or in a large area. Its harder to spot enemies in closed area like a single bedroom.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Opera News: Breaking Local & US Headlines","description":"We‚Äôre proud to be enjoyed and trusted by over 350 million global users.

It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","I mostly do the single player offline, and it's pretty fun and entertaining at first. After a little while the missions start to get kind of repetitive and boring, multiplayer is ok. I definitely got enjoyment out of it though. I'd give it a 5.8/10","I love this game and I love the gameplay, but I think having the ability to reset missions in the single missions mode to keep having the constant ability to earn the rewards there with out having to spend a lot of time.","Ok the reson I gave this app 1 star is becuse every time I get on my favort game (zomibe rush) it get me on but ever time I get on I like can't move i only can change my wepone. And about the hackers every time I get on free fight they a dude name hacker and he is a hacker he got a gun that shoot bullets but it blow stuff up. And he made himself the king like he allways come after me.

I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static. Still, it's great for people who use wired headphones. I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","This app came preinstalled with my phone and is one of the few that I haven't tried to remove. It doesn't require an internet connection and so is the perfect go to entertainment when I have no mobile data. The sound quality is as good as any radio, with the convenience of having it on your mobile device. There are no in app purchases to unlock stations or premium features. It's the only radio I need.","It don't work, I have wireless headphones and all I heard was static. The app doesn't align with modern technology. I guess you need headphones with a cord (which is almost non existent) to use SMH. I going to try and uninstall !","NO NEED TO UPDATE Every cell phone is Capable of receiving FM RADIO SIGNALS but need a small app to grant access. I found NO DIFFERENCE with update so I uninstalled them and runs the Same because it's just a FM radio, so I'm not sure what 15 mgb's in update for ? (nothing necessary- it's zero mgb's on factory.) Who's worried about spying..

I get chests everyday , I have 1000 diamonds and I also like my daily levels , the reason I love this game is because I get to have featured levels , quests and all for free!

And 82 things like icons , ships ,balls , ufos , waves , robots, spiders , trails , death effects and colors. This one is a little bit better than geometry dash (but not full version) so,yeah!","This game is amazing, theres alot of things to do and its very fun. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because everytime I get diamonds from quests something weird happens. Everytime I leave and come back for some reason I start to loose my diamonds. I used to have 150 diamonds but now I have 130. It's very wierd and annoying but although of that this games is good!","It has amazing music and the obstacles are abstract and colourful, the beat matches every obstacle as well. It's an amazing game, and I recommend it to those who have fast fingers and like electronic music. I have no complaints about this game, so it earns a five-star rating from me. If at First You Don't Succeed, try, try again.","I completed gd world in just 1 attempt, super fun and colorful, different varieties of icons, colors, online+daily lvls, perfect sync, lots of things to collect and most definitely great soundtracks!

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth! Had huge glitch on my game play, took a couple of weeks to fix, they got it done!!! Thank you all. Awesome job well done. Totally locked in forever. üëçüëç Once again the Tech Team has stepped up to Excellence. Thanks üòä 7.21.21","Fantastic idea ! 2 stars missing because this game does not load properly. Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building. It also have military, airport, railway, minerals, space oruented,....etc 3.In each and every places has unique song i really have enjoyed it. 4.
