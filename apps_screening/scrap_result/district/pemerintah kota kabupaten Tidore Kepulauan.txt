Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Sygic GPS Navigation & Offline Maps","description":"Sygic GPS, Navigation is the world‚Äôs most downloaded Offline GPS navigation app, trusted by more than 200 million drivers.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Smashy Road: Wanted","description":"SMASHY ROAD: WANTED\r\n\r\nYou are WANTED!

Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going.

The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top.","I thought a Wikipedia app was redundant since the website already exists, but saving articles offline, transferring them between devices, and the clean reading experience with dark mode makes this app and a new account worth it to me. Haven't tried editing with this app yet though. My biggest issue so far is that \"Explore\" should be easier to get to, especially from an open tab. The tabs themselves took some getting used to after coming from iPhone. Small tweaks needed in that area.","It used to be fine, but now in dark or black mode, a lot of text is white on a white background. This usually happens in album track lists or TV show episode lists. Wikipedia kind of uses a white table to display the information, but keeps the text white on top of this table. The only way to see the text is to select the text (as of you are going to copy it) or if the text itself is hyperlink.","UPDATE: layout\\design. App auto-updated itself 2 days ago. (Thanks glitchy PlayStore!) Now app looks 1st gen: bulky & bloated. My previous ver showed (3) \"In the news\" thumbnails; now only 1. PREVIOUSLY; Tech glitch: occasionally, my Favs are cleared w\\o warning (and without clearing app or Samsung Note 5 caches or data). Current open tabs remain, but favorites are deleted.

I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Free Music MP3 Player (Download LITE)","description":"MixerBox Lite is a popular All-In-One media player that lets you Play Free Music & TV Shows.

None of the FAQs or the Support topics address this issue, and I can't find a way to ask for assistance with this issue via the app itself. This is making the app less effective for me b/c it's a hassle to sign in every time I use it and it might not be providing accurate information when it times out.","There is no way to reset the password if your email account is not valid. My child deleted the app and when i reinstalled I can't remember the password. She doesn't have email on her phone and her school email i used is no longer valid. Contacted help to request they delete the phone number so I can start over. Nothing back. Might have to go to a different app for all family members if I can't get this fixed.","This app is a trash. Your location is shown only when you are active in the app otherwise you can't track the device you're looking for. It shows \"the device data/wifi has been turned off since...\". I lost my phone and couldn't trace it but the phone itself was turned on with data.","Love the fact it shows when my family makes it home safely. I really like this app, and I'm just using the free version. But, the pro plan is only $7.99/month","I noticed that it says my daughter is in a different location, like 12 miles away.

The only downside is it is quite quirky and I lost two purchases that amounted to over $40 because I was changing screens too quickly they say. I have no proof so I'm out my money but the game is awesome just needs work on how it runs.","I think the game is great. Its fun and keeps me fairly preoccupied. The biggest issue I have with this game is the customer service. I spend more than my fair share purchasing game packs. The one time I had an issue with mafia city's system updates, I reached out and all I hear were excuses as to why theh are unable to give me back the gold I purchased (by the way).","Just another city builder/resource management sim, but with a \"mafia\" theme. Nothing like the ads you've seen. Pushy with microtransactions but definitely not the worst I've experienced. The audio quality is awful and the art style is nothing special. My #1 gripe is when games like this block you from the 2nd building slot with no way to unlock other than spending real money, such is the case here. If you're actually into this style of game you can find much better elsewhere.","So far so good. Have not experienced any serious issues. I will see how much of a Pay 2 Win gane this is, though I am hoping it won't be too bad. Graphics are good and the artwork and design of various characters are well done. Put in more action into this game and I will raise my rating to 5 stars.","Very bad. Train troops for months and wipe out in few hours by other stronger rich players that spend with money. Not a game for those that does not want to spend money at all. Stop wasting your time.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn‚Äôt start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful.

This app is amazing... but the issue is. On my galaxy A11, the app works smoothly when I open the app, then after a few minutes staying on the app it starts to lag. When it gets really bad it either locks up my phone, black screen, and or the app closing out by itself... I want to enjoy the full experience of the app because I love to explore.

Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. üôÇ Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.)

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles.

What a waste of time it was you need different speed ups for different things like troops for example there is no generic speed up for all troop types but multiple types of speed ups you can only use for certain class plus for me to progress from where I left I have to spend a tonne of money I cant upgrade or do research unless I buy packs this is not a free to play game. It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!! And for the RICHIE RICH PEOPLE out there that loves to spend $$$$$ then go play Mobile Strike Gaming and you'll feel right at Home then tooo!!!!
