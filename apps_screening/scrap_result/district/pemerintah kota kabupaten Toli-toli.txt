There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

So, try this app, you don't have nothing to lose and it's free. You won't regret it. Oh, it has songs for new school too even rap and music today up to the 2000's. So, as you can see this app is good for all ages.","Great music. Loving the music I grew up with as a teenager and the great summers, care free and no worries. Such lovely days.

Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other.

In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GO Music - Offline & online music, free MV, MP3","description":"Enjoy online & offline music streaming of millions of trending songs on demand.

I could search songs, nothing glitched, it was amazing. But eventually, I wasn't and still aren't able to search songs. The first page it opens when you click on the app, says that the service is offline. And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth! Had huge glitch on my game play, took a couple of weeks to fix, they got it done!!! Thank you all. Awesome job well done. Totally locked in forever. 👍👍 Once again the Tech Team has stepped up to Excellence. Thanks 😊 7.21.21","Fantastic idea ! 2 stars missing because this game does not load properly. Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building. It also have military, airport, railway, minerals, space oruented,....etc 3.In each and every places has unique song i really have enjoyed it. 4.

And make sure the ladders are useable if u added them, and b4 the ladders rise up, maybe make a feature like us controlling the ladder in the basket.

The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Baca - Baca Berita Terkini & Video Humor","description":"BACA merupakan konten aggregator yang mengumpulkan konten dari beragam sumber berita terpercaya dan menyajikannya kepada kamu setiap saat.

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly.

With a great interface, nice preference options, and new tabs for special issues (Elections, COVID, Olympics, etc.). I find the issue of ads overblown, and are fairly limited. Overall, this app is definitely worth it for those looking for diverse news.","I've used this app for years now, and I've liked it a lot. Ads are getting way too intrusive now, they're injecting ads into every news story that you open, On the main feeds after every three news articles was an ad, and with the latest update the ads are now showing large graphics. And also when you open the story and then try and exit ads are popping up, and in some cases prompting you to install software which is dangerous as hell. Just about at the end of my rope with this app.","Love the app, it's great for getting news from a lot of different sources. Recently updated and had to ability to pick topics I am interested in. Only reason its 4 and not 5 stars is I wish you could also pick news I don't want to see. Like I see WAY too many articles by news sites that are extremely biased (uber left or right), just wish there was a way to filter certain sites out.","Used to be a great news resource. Now it's littered with ads that you can not back out of. You have to completely close the app! Each article is just packed full of ads; it's hard to read the article itself! The \"top\" news source that is forced on you is where a lot of the ads are too! You can customize other interests but you have to navigate between the article itself and the annoying ads. Time to look for a new news app!","I've had this app for quite a while. I like it alot. Format is good. Recently, it's getting glitchy. I keep reinstalling it in hopes of improved performance. Hasn't helped. I have a pixel 3a. It's a strong phone so I don't think it's my phone. Good luck with bugs. Good site otherwise. I must add I agree with others that ads are killing it. I don't mind some but video ads and page block adds don't cut it.

I enjoy this app because of the bible translation, its easy to read and its very accurate. Plus the video teaching tools are a great help. Now i can understand and help others understand the truth.","It's the best tool to reason with others with the truth. Suggestion, add a hebrew English bible. It will be 6 stars. And I really love the convenience of the update to finding answers of the meaning of a scripture it's very easy now no longer having to go outside of the app to do the research but I can do the research just a tap of the button and there it is. I love it, I love it I love it, I love it... praise Jehovah our God.","Amazing work, brothers and sisters! May Jehovah continue to bless your efforts. This app is beyond helpful! I hope that one day in the future, we will be able to sync the app in all our devices. Could there someday be a log in feature so that all of our notes are saved no matter which device we use? This is only a suggestion. ❤🙏🏾","Very grateful for this amazing tool! Could you maybe add dark theme for easier reading at night? There's also a bug causing publications to open in the language of the app instead of the chosen language that maybe you could look into at some point? Also, when some of the older original songs start playing, the app keeps turning them off and on again all the time and the whole app crashes. A few more inconveniences that make things harder at meetings but won't fit it here. Thank you! :) ♥️","What a resourceful app. So many great learning tools in one place. If you're a Bible reader and lover, you will appreciate the JW Library. If you haven't read the Bible or maybe are reluctant to do so because you find it hard to understand, then this app is especially for you. It's so educational and inspiring, for children and adults."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.jw.jwlibrary.mobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jw.jwlibrary.mobile&hl=en&gl=us"}]
