How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home. So, instead of just opening the tracker in another browser tab, the developers in their infinite wisdom have decided that it is better if you unlock your phone, open the app, and then be able to locate.

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering.

The first page it opens when you click on the app, says that the service is offline. And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"YouTube Kids","description":"A video app made just for kids\r\nYouTube Kids was created to give kids a more contained environment filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness.

I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going. They need to fix that but is something I could live with it. Using Google pixel 5","I've read through your support forums. Can't find answers. Issue started Aug 2nd. All features work except sms. Running android 10. When not connected to car google assistant able to read texts. When connected to android auto I can text people but when I get a reply it shows on car's screen but when I press steering wheel button google assistant says 'there aren't any new messages that I can read.'

Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

I think only texting is unlimited, though. Upon initially signing up a few months ago, I received 60 free minutes; I have 15 free minutes remaining now. You can either complete offers or watch videos (never seen any videos available) for extra free minutes or by purchasing them in the app.","Turn off the intusive ad audio! This app used to be excellent but the ads are now to the point of making the app unusable. I've had to close out the app many times to get the advertising to stop. Only keeping it for now until my minutes run out.","Anytime a \"free\" app has intrusive advertisements that are able to completely cutoff my usage of said app's possible features and abilities to the point i have to close out the advertisement before I am able, or better yet, before it is even possible to continue to use the application,to any degree, as it is intended or otherwise. I have to wonder, have I got the application because I enjoy my ability to close out of intrusive pop-ups? Not likely. ZERO STARS.","I thank you for this app. When a person is down on there luck and can make important phone calls to get back on their feet. I love this app and have had zero issues with it and it is cheap to have a number for a small monthly fee.","They have pop-ups that pop up more than anything I've ever seen. It's totally obvious, they want to make their pop-ups so erratically aggravating.. that you will opt into paying them $4.99 for a monthly subscription... and while I might be willing to pay $4.99 for a month... I don't want to be locked in to doing a revolving subscription, or even having to go online and trying to find a way to cancel and blah blah blah..

So now, I have 2 of EVERYTHING and half of which don't work meaning you can't play the video or see the picture. How this app is rated so well is beyond me.","Overall this app is good, but some videos are being downloaded in a 240p quality format as default, and i can't choose whether the quality i want is 720p or more. I suggest that we could download more than 3 videos at the same time (because only 3 videos are being downloaded at the same time) [EDIT] This app is literally the best app u can find in playstore. But the problem is, everytime I download video in hd format, the audio is missing, and I have no choice but to download the default 240p.","I really love this App! It's very Useful and Very easy to use! It's working properly, Now I can finally download high quality videos! I tried other apps, but when I download it, it doesn't have a option of which quality should I choose. But this app has, and it's not that high! It really helped me a lot!😁🥰","I will say for only using the app one time it's very easy to use and works well. Very nicely designed GUI, and has some unexpected very useful options also. This will be my video downloader from now on. Highly recommend⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","Great app. I can download all may favourite videos in any site. I'll give a 5stars because I really love this app. Thank you so much!

I thought it was just me, but after reading some reviews, it isn't just me. I can't open stories anymore. I've restarted my phone plenty of times, and even if a story opens, it crashes after 2 seconds. My whole screen is stuck, I can't cross the story, I can't move anything, nothing works until I press my home button. Even while searching, sometimes if I stay on google for more that 2 mins, the app just sends me to my home page. Otherwise good. Really I loved 👌","I love this game. It's a great game for connecting with different people, but it has its flaws. For example, I'll tap on a message and instead of opening the DM, it'll register as me holding it down, which brings up a menu that's annoying to get out of. Features all around the app spontaneously disappear and I must uninstall and redownload the app as a whole. It frequently hiccup's, but it's still good nevertheless. Please work out these issues, they're just frustrating.","Awesome! love it! I was very happy with the service but not satisfied.I think its a great app to socialliaze with your friends. Although is can be riskey and random people can add you. You can make a bunch of new friends to. You can have streaks, you have a ball of different colors that you choose, no shots are available! Second, often when the game ends that you leave nothing, and there is no way to move on! It is so easy. you can download the dictionaries. It is very intresting app","Such a fantastic app. Easy to download videos and many amazing things are in this app. The voice chat has a mind of its own. It would randomly stop working entirely: 3. After a game ends and you are taken to the lobby. 4. If the microphone is turned off during a match. 5. If you switch to a wired earphone from a bluetooth earphone. 6. In case you disconnect your wired headphone. And the only way to fix it, is to restart the game by killing it from the memory. Device used: Oneplus 7, OS: Android9","Awesome! I love it! It's great, but.... I'm not quite sure if it's my network, my device, or the app itself, but I'm experiencing a lot of lag while on video chats. The connection happens to cut off in a lot of places. Then I have situations where the video does finally reconnect, but the synchronization between video feedback and audio is delayed. For instance, I'll hear my friend's voice, then see their mouth move a few seconds later. Other than that, I love the app, it's a great platform, keep Snapping!🤘💀🤘"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"app.buzz.share","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.buzz.share&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PlayKids - Cartoons, Books and Educational Games","description":"Children learn to read, watch videos, and read ebooks.

The number is initially free though so it is only a problem if you need the number to be secure, for example, if you're going to use the number for apps/logins to verify your identity through text. Textnow allows you to buy a secure phone number at a one-time price.","If you got this app thinking you'll be able to create a secondary account for Telegram/WhatsApp/etc , then think again because this app won't receive any messages about verification codes , if any messages at all.

Calling hardly ever works, half the time I press call and it gets stuck at dialing or saying \"there's been a kurfuffle in the call factory\" and it doesn't go through. I paid for extra minutes and I cannot depend on this app for communication at all. Texting seems to work fine but I also require calls, something this app is supposed to do.","it' a great app to have because my wife and I only have 1 phone don't really need two due to the fact that we work together so we use this app to communicate when we're not together which is rare but comes in handy instead of waisting money on a phone that is never really used . thank you for your service a pleased customer.","Ads are super intrusive! The kind that pop up on the screen and you can't x out for 35 seconds. That's on top of ads covering part of the screen during general use. Also there's no option to buy the secure phone number for one time payment, only a monthly subscription. Text now has the option for a one-time payment.","Disgusted.

Every time I used the app, I'd get 5 minutes of music and 30 minutes of spin (nothing). Didn't matter how strong my signal was, it wouldn't play. All settings on my phone was correct. This wasn't another app seizing the speaker. The damn thing just wouldn't play. I don't need that type of aggravation. There, app owner, does that satisfy your demand?","This app had a terrible feature where you had to listen to a 40+ second ad every single time you hit play on a station. This made it incredibly awful to use. The app has since been updated and removed this flaw. Returned to being an outstanding app, and I really appreciate them listening to customers! EDIT: And we're back to one star again. App developer brought back the advertisement you must listen to EVERY time you connect to a station. Awful feature.","I don't usually listen to the radio, however since I found and picked this App out, it has yet to let me down. As far as i can see, their is a varity of music and channels to pick from. I have yet to explore everything but 4 me this is perfect! Hope this App serves you well. TLAZCAMATI.","I like this app. Going on a few days now. I do wish we could type in the number channel we're looking for. Besides that, great radio app. Update - been a few months & this is my go to. Especially while I'm cleaning or showering. Picks up all stations, even my favorite locals... Radio stations have adds & commercials, duh. So please don't punish this app for that. Some of these young people have no idea what a radio station is. 😂","This is basically useless if you're not looking for a large radio station or if you don't have an exact frequency Edit in response to reply: I was trying to connect to my personal tv tower (transmits audio from my blu-ray via radio) and this just doesn't work for that since it's an imitation radio and not actually working off of radio frequencies. There's also not an option to test several frequencies at once if you don't know the exact frequency for pretty much the same reason."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.radio.fmradio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radio.fmradio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Podcasts","description":"With Google Podcasts, you can play the latest episodes from your favorite shows, explore podcast recommendations just for you, and manage your listening activity.\r\n\r\nDiscover podcasts you'll love \r\n• Subscribe and listen to all your favorite podcasts for free. \r\n• Explore show and episode recommendations just for you. \r\n• Browse popular and trending shows in comedy, news, history, music, business, TV & film, education, health & fitness, technology, arts, science, sports, and more. \r\n\r\nCustomize your listening experience\r\n• Listen at faster playback speeds or skip over silences. \r\n• Queue up episodes for a seamless listening experience. \r\n• Easily keep track of your listening history, downloads, and subscriptions.\r\n\r\nListen wherever you are \r\n• Listen on multiple devices - phone, laptop, smart speaker - without losing your place. \r\n• Stream episodes for instant playback or auto-download episodes to listen offline and on the go. \r\n• Discover podcasts using Google Search and Google Assistant. \r\n\r\nTo learn more, visit our Help Center: https://support.google.com/websearch/topic/9739148?hl=en&ref_topic=3036132&p=podcasts&visit_id=637190448011338458-2709322194&rd=1","descriptionHTML":"With Google Podcasts, you can play the latest episodes from your favorite shows, explore podcast recommendations just for you, and manage your listening activity.<br><br>Discover podcasts you&#39;ll love <br>• Subscribe and listen to all your favorite podcasts for free. <br>• Explore show and episode recommendations just for you. <br>• Browse popular and trending shows in comedy, news, history, music, business, TV &amp; film, education, health &amp; fitness, technology, arts, science, sports, and more. <br><br>Customize your listening experience<br>• Listen at faster playback speeds or skip over silences. <br>• Queue up episodes for a seamless listening experience. <br>• Easily keep track of your listening history, downloads, and subscriptions.<br><br>Listen wherever you are <br>• Listen on multiple devices - phone, laptop, smart speaker - without losing your place. <br>• Stream episodes for instant playback or auto-download episodes to listen offline and on the go. <br>• Discover podcasts using Google Search and Google Assistant. <br><br>To learn more, visit our Help Center: https://support.google.com/websearch/topic/9739148?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3036132&amp;p=podcasts&amp;visit_id=637190448011338458-2709322194&amp;rd=1","summary":"A podcast player, from Google.

I like how clean and straightforward the UI is. I just wish that casted podcasts would play at the increased playback speed.","Amazing app. The app UI sleek and straightforward, eliminating distracting clutter, and overall has a good feel to it. Although, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about my experience with podcasts in general. This app helped me fall in love with fiction audio dramas, which is a medium I wasn't expecting to enjoy. I can listen while driving or cooking, or I can just sit back and let my eyes focus on nothing in particular. Overall, my experience has been phenomenal.","Really like this app, especially the ability to speed up podcasts in 10% increments, unlike other apps which use increments of 25%. Two things that would make this perfect: 1. Additional functionality in the playlist like a multi-select feature and move to top/bottom option. 2. Ability to rewind/forward from the lock screen widget instead of having to unlock it every time. If forward is disabled for advertisers then at least give us the ability to rewind.","I use it daily. Player shows as 2 different apps in recent apps, which is a weird bug. Variety of other issues but nothing too major. Downloads/play only seem to work for rather recent pods, and if you find some interesting stuff from say 2012, they won't download or play for some reason. Crashes have become less frequent (thanks devs!). Still my go to for podcasts. Submitted as requested. Can't get pic of the 2 instances showing up as it's doing it in android itself when bringing up recentapps","Google pixel 2 - using app for 3 yrs - app feedback/ bug reports don't seem to be helping. Since the addition of a queue a while back (was much needed), I always download and add episodes to my queue simultaneously. Now, episodes are randomly removed from the queue and cannot be re-added (they remain in downloads but the \"add to queue\" flashes green and then back to blue).

I can log in to any computer, pull up my ph number & immediately start using it as well. There are many other features too. Just an all around great app.","I've been using Google Voice for over 5 years (prior to and after the 'merge' with Hangouts). It gives me the freedom to make calls and texts over IP/WiFi or thru my phone plan. If I'm sitting at my computer I can call or answer in my browser. The biggest issue I've had with Voice is its lack of integration with Google Contacts. It maintains its own contact list and will not search my Contacts. Hey Google! Can you add a 'Use Google Contacts' option so Voice can search and sync with Contacts?","Mostly work as intended. One really annoying problems though: when new messages come in, the notification bar blocks the text input field. tapping anywhere on the screen will just make the notification bar last longer. You literally have to stare at the screen and wait for it to disappear to start typing again, until the next new message comes in, wait for another 3 seconds. Please fix this.","I've been using gv for years and right now it's on my Galaxy S20 FE phone. For the past week or two, though, any calls to/from my gv number aren't working right. When someone calls my gv number, I can't hear them and they cannot hear me. The same thing happens when I call them using the gv app to place the call. I uninstalled the app, rebooted my phone and reinstalled the app and gv worked to receive one call - it worked perfectly. But every call afterwards was the same as before: I can't hear the caller and the caller cannot hear me. The same when I place a call. I have also reset the app data and cache and again: it works for one call and then not again.","I've enjoyed Google and the Voice app for quite some time. On June 28 I was prompted to update my Voice app and did so. After that I've been unable to make calls or send texts. This renders the app unusable. Yikes! I gave it three stars because it's been great until now... Any help or ideas on how to fix this are welcome."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.googlevoice","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googlevoice&hl=en&gl=us"}]
