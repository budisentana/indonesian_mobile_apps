There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth!

Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game.

The different game modes are awesome, and the reward system is generous. The Hero/Villain Roster is amazing! I was playing SW:GOH, for years and the developers ended up ruining the game over the years. They focused more on making money rather than keeping it fun. The rewards became very slim. But, if this games stays the way it is with great reward drops, and fairly priced in-game purchases, I'll play this game everyday, and I'll gladly recommend it to everyone I can.","Amazing game. Is not a money grab like the avengers game. It be cool if they can bring some new cools updates. Such as Allowing to invite random people to an alliance. Able to join a random alliance. Heroic mode cost a lot of energy so there a limit of how much you can play. Overall is an amazing game. But the game might need more funding and cool features to get more players Still derseve 5 starts","Been playing for 4 years or more daily (absolutely love it). Best mobile game to date. Very in depth rpg system. Every battle can be different with tons of different play styles. We'll over a 100 characters maybe even nearing 200 now. You can play this game daily for 10 minutes or a few hours to get daily challenges it's all up to you. Or you can play in few minute increments if your a busy worker. Not pay to win, paying only helps you boost a little faster but not necessary. Favorite game!","Great game, especially for beginners, but the grind is made too long and most characters become useful only after certain Legendary Skills have been unlocked, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money very early on you won't have these abilities that make most characters good, also energy goes way too fast, and instead of having a node be playable without recharging it 3 times make it 5, a too hardcore grind right off the bat will make some players quit the game","I've been playing faithfully for three years, got all the characters, was really strong, then they go and add one character (Black Flash) that makes it where you can't do anything and die every single time. It was great until they added that character. TONE DOWN BLACK FLASH SO WE CAN DO PLAY INSTEAD OF ALL CHARACTERS BEING DEFEATED BEFORE WE CAN EVEN DO ONE ATTACK!!!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.wb.goog.dc.legends","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.dc.legends&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Waplog - Dating App to Chat & Meet New People","description":"Waplog Dating App\r\n\r\nThe fastest-growing dating app with more than 90 million users worldwide.

That is not enough time, and to automatically start charging your Google Play account, I thought this app had a free version. I can't get to the free version. What ever happened to \"try before you buy? Edit: OK, it is possible to kill both\" free trial offer\" screens and try the app, just a lot of ads. I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate. A free trial means you don't need to do anything to use it, including making an effort to subscribe. UPD: sorry, my bad. Didn't notice the X button.

It's really a great game. Rephrase that. If money wasn't the top priority this app would be so awesome for all consumers to enjoy. If u don't have 100 bucks a week to spend at the least. Don't play ffxv.","You can play free to play but its made so that some items are only available for a limited time or never and if you miss them you have to wait until they are offered as a prize months later. The p2p players can gift others a catch up token which often includes things past the paywall which is nice. Its a war game much much more than a city building one. Tries to get you to spend $. And different pack offers based on spending tier.","This game is legitimate garbage. All it does is drag the final fantasy name through the mud. You try and play and just get one tapped by someone 2 levels above you since they love balancing to make players spend money. If you don't spend or know people who will help you by spending than you're not gonna go anywhere. The support, sorry \"support\" actually told me when I have issues its my fault. I asked about the scaling of their events. They said its only for high levels spend money. GG Greed","I give it 5 stars cause it has helped me thru very tough times. Being able to talk communicate and strategize with other players. Never experienced anything like it. I was able to stay out of trouble and to better my life at same time. We all experience difficulties on buying packs. But truthfully I'm seeing people that has not spent money are hardly any catch up to the rest of us that do spend regularly.This is why buying the empire boosts are a must.This is what makes you better. GOD bless","0/10 Would not recommend. Pros: If you don't value your time and money, Congratulations you are the target audience for this game.

I deleted the files but the app no longer runs without them. Is it so complicated to have a big button to just turn off the voice assist that to me is as annoying a Karen telling what to do?","It has changed a lot since I used it in the passed, less intuitive. Obviously need to read the manual and then re-review.","The app can take 2 or three tries to fully function in Android Auto. That's a problem. Also it does not matter what channel or volume you set in the app the voice engine will cut out source audio. You can have the voice or you can have silence but you can't navigate to a point and listen to anything without interruption. Unless there is a solution the developer will not share this app is not ready for Primetime.","Closing the app in system task manager caused that all my saved routes GONE! Same thing with blocked roads edited by myself. All gone. Need to fix this or set a reminder for users that they always have to close the app proper using 'Exit', not just killing it in task manager. BTW. 'average speed' panel doesn't work.","Maps not bad (OSM); interface/search atrocious. Example: asks for country; type United it prompts with Kingdom, back up, type States - frowny face. Must type name of state, which isn't a country. When you get a possibility there is no \"show on map\" except in various unfathomable contexts. Getting beyond Last Search takes gymnastics and a few MAJOR shopping centers in my area not in database. So, free, navigation OK, UI big flunk. Needs real user input + UI/workflow redesign.

Mario Kart Tour doesn't feature invasive ads. sorry, this fancy version of Temple Run doesn't get to ruin my fun with non-removable ads. the nostalgia isn't worth a poor mobile game experience","It a really cool game, I used to play it all the time when it first came out and I just came back to it recently. I like it but there are a few bugs that need fixing. Mostly the event bug. After a few runs it doesn't save anymore progress, it'll just stay at a certain number, but it will use up your tickets. It's frustrating when it uses up all your tickets and your \"mines destroyed\" number is still the same number as before you used the ticket(s). Please fix the event bug, thank you.","Do you remember the first game? If you do you can see the bunch of problems from the new one if you don't I'm very shocked anyway now getting to the point of it first of all the animation aren't really smooth second of all to me it's really glitchy second of all why are they all Naruto running??????? That when I was like an answer the fact of the animations are not smooth and it's glitchy basically just ruined the whole entire game for me iI'm sorry but you have to fix this immediately","I gave this game one star because of multiple reasons and I don't think I was the only one that had these issues with this game. The game controls are very bad. Even worse than the first game's controls. Sometimes I tried to go to the left and the game would send me all the way to the right. This happened way more times than I can keep track of. This game is very unfinished and the developers almost never worked on it after it was released. I saw the game, tried it and it was worse than 06. Fix","I played this game in an IPhone 7 for years and it didn't give me issues. I had everyone maxed out. Now I changed to an android and now runs really bad. This game laggs so hard that the game freezes and crashes all together. When an event appears, I use all the tickets and loose all of my progress on that run. I've tried three times and it gives me the same results. This update is garbage!

But it does give you Joy","The gold crest has defeated me, I just feel I have paid for something I can't complete and feel a bit let down. I've failed over 50 times now and it's cost me too much time and game cash, I'm completely deflated now. It's so frustrating because it's something I paid for so it should be easier to complete but no, it's just sucking the life out of the game.

First of all, dragon stones take for ever to gather, and second of all, I hate how hard it is to get a featured unit on banner, because it costs 50 dragon stones per multi-summon and you have a very low chance to get the new unit. I just wish there was a way to guarantee you get the unit after a specific amount of summons, but instead we have red coins that take forever to gather up.","Don't listen to the 1 star reviews. This game is great. They're just crying because they didn't get the unit they wanted. They also don't understand that Gacha games are based around summoning, and that rates are always terrible. All in all however, Dragon Stones are distributed pretty generously and if you're smart and save them for the right banners, you'll almost always walk out with something to show for it.","Tbh, I'm just loving the nostalgia that comes from seeing all these characters, in one place, again. I wish it was just a BIT more simple to navigate and determine what it is, you need, to advance. Who's more valuable, as there are several of each character to obtain. Certain little things could, ultimately, help game play: overall, I enjoy it. I'll be back to revise. If you like, or have ever liked, DBZ this is a good entry point into the universe. The memories, alone, make it worth a look.","I love the game, it's great, but you gotta make stones easier to get. People like me can't just spend a thousand dollars on this game for a slight boost in power. An honest and fair opinion, add a new missions tab, make it daily missions that are somewhat hard/time consuming, and when you've completed them all you get 50 stones, and make it only available for level 200+,I'd say that's fair","Ever since the changeover in management, the Global side of Dokkan has been getting better and better.

It's not like other games where you are forced to watch ads to do anything, so that's a huge plus. I can never get bored of this game and I'm in love with the character designs and the graphics and everything about it. There is a power system, stopping you from playing for hours and hours, but I like it because then I can get out and do things, instead of being a couch potato. Thanks for creating such an amazing, fun, game!","The Game is well designed in appearing the smallest deatails of each character, however each variant of the charter all ways has the same special 1 and 3, to make it appealing and interesting you could change the super speacial to something a little different to other character. The survivor mode is fun but the wheel of fortune is not balanced in terms of probability, i tend to get more crystals then any other prize on the wheel. But over all its a whell designed game.","This game is epic I love how it is offline because all offline games are soo boring unlike this one. I think there needs to be an update and include more player though. On my tablet this game is perfect but on my phone for some reason after I've played a battle it goes off the game and into my home screen so I never get my XP and have to do the fight again but it still takes my energy bars and the process repeats so I dont move on.

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently.

Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it.

For technical help, please email appstore@tunein.com.","comments":["Pretty good app overall, but one major negative is that it loses connection a lot and every time I hit pause, even if it's just for a few seconds, the app makes me listen to a 30 second ad! Very, very very annoying when I'm listening to a live sports game! Please stop being so greedy and fix this issue! Put like a 5 minute grace period in or something reasonable.","Enjoy this application for many years now. However, recently I am having issues with the sleep timer on my favorite radio station. Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","It's a good app, you can access 1000s of stations but one of the joys that made it similar to listening to a real live radio was the sleep timer feature. It's not working on the current version for some reason which is a shame and a pain. Not an issue if listening during the day, I would imagine though.","App often goes into endless cycle of ads and doesn't return to radio station I'm listening to. I understand having ads when I'm not paying for subscription but I just listened to 20 minutes of ads and had to turn off because it won't return to radio station I was listening to. Have to close, reopen, listen to more ads then back to station. And then when radio station returns from its own commercial break TuneIn will suddenly cut to its own ads & begins endless cycle of ads w/o return to station."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"tunein.player","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&hl=en&gl=us"}]
