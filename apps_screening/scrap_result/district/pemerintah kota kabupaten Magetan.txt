Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included . This will limit their use on mobile ."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"FM Radio","description":"Motorola FM Radio makes it easy to scan for stations, build your favorites list, set your sleep timer, record the best songs, and see live information about what’s playing -- all with a cool Material Design look. \r\n\r\nThis application has been designed to work on Motorola phones with an enabled FM chipset and running Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and above.

I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static.

I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","The app work fine but when you quit an app it's notification keeps persistent for a couple of seconds. The app doesn't look very modern, it looks like it's from 2010. The app keep removing the names of radio stations I saved. So please fix it.

The sound quality is as good as any radio, with the convenience of having it on your mobile device. There are no in app purchases to unlock stations or premium features.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going.

Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little. But they slowed the car like WAY too much.","It's an okay game. It would be better though if it didn't give you THE SAME CARS when you use cash for them. The more you get cars the more it happens. Not only that but when you hit an oil tank truck and it blows up you fall through the ground instead of landing back down. The tanks are unnecessarily overpowered they shoot at you and flip you then you get back up and flip again over over until you get wrecked!","This game is very fun, unfortunately, the time amount of time it takes to get arrested varies and the game does glitch.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful.

You can't search within a podcast so you have to scroll until you find the one you want and since they are ordered from new to old, if you let it play automatically, it'll play \"in reverse\" (i.e. Part 2 would play before Part 1.) and every now and then, instead of staying the next episode, it'll go back to the top and play the latest.","When it works nothing beats it but lately it is worst than Sirus.....which is bad. Cuts out every half song...then I wait about 5 minutes and some times it comes back but mostly I need to stop the song and restart it. Very frustrating when trying to get a tan on a beach. The web site on the computer is #1.... but the app for the phone is a big ZERO.","I totally love this app!!! It works good, but there are two problems with it. There are too many ads and also I also had trouble for some time keeping the Bluetooth connection when I open the app and play a radio station or podcast or anything on the app. I know there is nothing wrong with me Bluetooth speaker. My speakers are fully charged and I can play everything else on it. Can you please look into it?","I used to enjoy this app more in the beginning but now not so much. I could add and delete songs and it would only play the songs I added. Now you can't delete any songs and it plays random songs not added by me. Also you can't add any Garth Brooks songs. I even tried the free trial for premium and still no luck. I tried to listen to Garth Brooks radio with unlimited skips and I heard one song from him and skipped over 50 times and nothing.

I would like it more and would definitely play it more. But the reward from effort ratio in game currency is a freakin joke. And the ad rewards are a damn insult. It would probably cost you less to operate a real airport than get yours in this game off the ground. This game could be awesome. Lower the damn prices on everything and raise the rewards for operating the airport 🤬. Until then. This game is grounded 😡.","The game play could be good but the money system is broken and it's almost impossible to earn enough money in any reasonable amount of time to do anything except let guests visit. The effort to reward ratio is skewed and even if I thought it was worth putting money in the game $10 gets you a single upgraded runway with a few coins left over and once stuff starts breaking plus upgrades it's impossible to do anything.","Game was fun starting out. But at lvl 10 everything is outrageously impossible to buy/fix/upgrade with income you earn. I understand that it's for profit but if everything needs upgrade/repairs at the same time. You can't afford anything to advance in the game. Was about to purchase a coin package but it's still not enough to do much. $10 package gets you 17k coins. 1 Runway is $15k, you have 2. need $6k city hall upgrade to build more houses. $4k terminal, $8k repair station etc","I give this 2 stars cus it's a cash cow game. How are you going to make everything well into the thousands of dollars and only give the player chump change to build with? I love the game the don't get me wrong it's the greed of it that is a dealbreaker..... Update Deleting this game complaints don't get results and progress would take centuries!!!","I have no idea how, but I notice that somehow they charged me $49.99 on March 1 for \"A Stack Of Coins\". I didn't even like the game and had already deleted it and now I notice the charge.. I deleted it because it was sitting there never being played taking up space on my phone. I reinstalled it today to see how many coins I allegedly bought, and it started a brand new game, no coins. No history of what happened.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate.

Suscription is axed, this works worse than Google Play Music with an horrible UI. Furthermore it does not integrate into any streaming service and equipment for music outside those few chromecast ones. Quality in sound is well behind other services as well... Is sad to say that the mismanegement of products in Google as of now makes me very suspicious to drop my money on anything google from now on. Sad.","After so many years, can we have some basic playlist editing features like SELECTING MULTIPLE SONGS or SORTING?!?!?!??!!?!?!?!?! These features are so basic that users started asking for them since the start of this sorry excuse you call a product. And great job ignoring us for years. I hope you are proud of yourselves: you took away a perfectly adequate product that is Google Play Music and incompetently gave us this pathetic \"fancy\" replacement with a stupid AI suggesting horrible songs and no adequate functionality to build our own playlists. You should thank the oligopoly that I still allow your undeserving staff to make money off of me. I'm paying mostly to get rid of youtube ads.","Seldom works as promised. If you want to stream random songs this might be fine, but it DOES NOT WORK to play your own music as requested. Completely fails to shuffle playlists: plays the same songs, in the same order, over and over, every time. WARNING - if you use this service to upload your own music files you can NOT get them back, except as unlabeled zip files without folders; they gave me mine as 44 different 2gig files I had to download individually. Crazy! Display of titles is shockingly awful: it often can't fit the whole song title or band name, across various platforms. The inability to select more than one track at a time is absurd and makes manipulating Playlists extremely cumbersome. Works half as well as Pandora but insists on reverting to its own recommendations rather than the requested songs. Functionality with Android Auto is spotty as best: in the car I can't NOT shuffle a playlist, on the TV via AndoirdTV I can only play a playlist in exact order, and using voice commands to my speaker it can't shuffle. Paying for Google1 access to try and fix the bugs was completely pointless, an offensive waste of time and money (\"Have you tried resetting and reinstalling it?\" LOL great support). They kept promising it was going to get better and it just keeps working worse... I've been a Premium member and was a Google Music Play user since day one (and happily would have paid that fee forever!), but now I'm quitting because I'm paying them a monthly fee in order to NOT stream my own music. This has been a horrendous nightmare inflicted on me by those I trusted most with my precious music library, and I don't plan on letting them forget about their failure any time soon. The fact that so many users have been requesting the addition of a Sleep Time for so long-- and it goes ignored-- shows me they just don't care. Most frustrating of all, every single problem I've mentioned was non-existent on the Google Play Music planform before this awful \"upgrade.\" Music lovers should steer far clear of this app if you hope to control your own listening experience.","Just a redirect to YouTube itself, prioritises videos over music. Can't find a browse by album. You're better off using the YouTubeMusic app on your phone and casting to your TV than using this app. At least that way you can browse or find albums/songs/artists you want and control their playback. O, and no background playback, so unlike every other music player app on Android TV (Spotify, Pandora, etc), you can't exit this app and let it run in the background while, say, having your screen saver run. How can Google's own music app on its own platform be worse than third party apps? Or even worse than what they have done before with GPM?! Regression, not progression from Google:(","Terrible experience. Hard to find any content, and if you do get lucky enough to find some content/playlist one day - good luck finding it again on another day, as it seems like it randomly changes what playlists and content is available to you, except for a few of the exact same things that always show up"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.youtube.tvmusic","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube.tvmusic&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"YouTube Music","description":"Connecting you to the world of music:\r\n● More than 70 million official songs\r\n● Music content including live performances, covers, remixes and music content you can’t find elsewhere\r\n● Thousands of curated playlist across many genres and activities\r\n\r\nGet personalized music, perfect for every moment:\r\n● Personalized playlists and Mixes made just for you, built around your favorite types of music\r\n● Personalized activity mixes for your Workout, Relax, and Focus sessions\r\n● Create playlists with song suggestions or collaborate with other music fans to create the perfect playlist\r\n● Personalized Library to see all of your liked and added songs, playlists, artists, and albums\r\n\r\nStay on top of the trend and discover new music:\r\n● Check out curated for you mixes such Discover Mix and New Release Mix\r\n● Discover music based genres (Hip Hop, Pop, Country, Dance & Electronic, Blues, Indie & Alternative, Jazz, Kpop, Latin, Rock, and more)\r\n● Discover music based mood (Chill, Feel Good, Energy Booster, Sleep, Focus, Romance, Workout, Commute, Party)\r\n● Explore top charts from all over the world\r\n\r\nEnhanced your listening experience with unique features:\r\n● Song lyrics so you can sing along to your favorites\r\n● Switch seamlessly between audio and video\r\n● Listen on your phone, desktop, smart speaker, smart TV, car, smart watch and within your favorite apps. \r\n● Compatible with Google Maps, Waze, Google Assistant, and more.\r\n\r\nUpgrade to Music Premium to enjoy:\r\n● Listen ad-free\r\n● Play music in the background\r\n● Access your downloads, including smart downloads\r\n● Switch seamlessly between audio and video, only with YouTube Music\r\n\r\n----------\r\nOnly first-time YouTube Red, Music Premium, YouTube Premium and Google Play Music subscribers are eligible for free trials, introductory offers or promotional pricing.\r\n\r\nMonthly price: $9.99 USD / $9.99 CAD / $11.99 AUD / $12.99 NZD / £12.99 / €9.99 / $99 pesos MXN / ₩7,900/ 99 kr NOK / 99 kr SEK / 99 kr DKK / 169 ₽ / ARS$99/ ₹99.00 IN / R59.99 ZA / ₡3,190 /$5.99 USD (EC, DO, UY, VE, GT, BO, HN, SV, PY, NI, PA) / 19.99 zł / RON22.00 / 149.00 Kč / Ft1,490.00 / lev8.99 / USD$5.99 (BY) / €5.99 (SK, SI) / €6.99 (GR, MT, CY, LT, LV, EE) / $6.99 (MK) / 13.99 Turkish Lira (TR) / kn59.99 (HR) / $9.99 (IS) / ₪19.90 (IL) / dh19.99 (AE) / Rial19.99 (QA) / $4.99 (BH, KW, OM, LB) / RP49,000 (ID) / NT$149.00 (TW) / ฿129.00 (TH) / ₱129.00 (PH) / $58.00 (HK) / RM 14.90 (MY) / $9.98 (SG) / USD$5.99 (VE) / ₦900.00 (NG) / $9.99 (TC) / £49.99 (EG) / USD$9.99 (AS, AW, GU, MQ, YT, PF, MP, PG, PR, TC, VI)/ USD$5.99 (BM, KY)/ €9.99 (GF, GP, NC)","descriptionHTML":"Connecting you to the world of music:<br>● More than 70 million official songs<br>● Music content including live performances, covers, remixes and music content you can’t find elsewhere<br>● Thousands of curated playlist across many genres and activities<br><br>Get personalized music, perfect for every moment:<br>● Personalized playlists and Mixes made just for you, built around your favorite types of music<br>● Personalized activity mixes for your Workout, Relax, and Focus sessions<br>● Create playlists with song suggestions or collaborate with other music fans to create the perfect playlist<br>● Personalized Library to see all of your liked and added songs, playlists, artists, and albums<br><br>Stay on top of the trend and discover new music:<br>● Check out curated for you mixes such Discover Mix and New Release Mix<br>● Discover music based genres (Hip Hop, Pop, Country, Dance &amp;

YouTube Music must have every song 🎵 in the world!! And eventually if you hit the like button often enough they will create a list of just your favorite songs/videos. I pay for YouTube premium and I'm sure that's why I don't get any ads at all. I'm very 😊 happy with YouTube Music so far.","This app is alright. I have premium, so I can't comment of the ads. The functions for listening to songs are quite good. However, ocationaly on songs it will say they are from a different artist, or play a song to what it says and what the album cover is. For example, when I went into thefatrat's \"Rise up\" it played a song called solitude instead. This was later fixed, however, if I go to the song, \"Kings and Queens Part two\" by Ava Max, it will sometimes play the wrong song.","The radio option is the only thing I really don't like about it. When you selected \"radio\" on an artist in Google play music it played songs that were from similar artists. YTM however, seems to play songs from artists that you've listened to a lot. Example: Hit the radio button on a power metal artist and the radio starts playing a bunch of TOOL because I've listened to them a lot and it really doesn't fit at all, especially when I'm using it to explore other artists in the power metal genre.","Not fit for purpose. I've been trying to work with this junk since launch. Spent months creating 12 playlists across 12 genres, totalling 9,170 tracks to listen to my playlists across my 7 Google hub max speakers. However, regardless of what playlist you select, even on shuffle, it will always start off playing the first track. It will then continue to play the same 20 or 30 tracks over and over again all day long even when playlist has over 1000 tracks. Switched to Spotify yesterday, heaven!!","I enjoy using the app. It creates several Mixes for you from different genres & eras that you listen to so you can choose what you're in the mood for. Every Wednesday there's a Discover Mix which I love. It's a mix of music they think you'll like based on your music choices. I'd give it 5 stars, but they took away the tab that used to drop down with your task bar. That was great bc you could skip through songs without leaving the app you're currently in.

Every time I used the app, I'd get 5 minutes of music and 30 minutes of spin (nothing). Didn't matter how strong my signal was, it wouldn't play. All settings on my phone was correct. This wasn't another app seizing the speaker. The damn thing just wouldn't play. I don't need that type of aggravation. There, app owner, does that satisfy your demand?","This app had a terrible feature where you had to listen to a 40+ second ad every single time you hit play on a station. This made it incredibly awful to use. The app has since been updated and removed this flaw. Returned to being an outstanding app, and I really appreciate them listening to customers! EDIT: And we're back to one star again. App developer brought back the advertisement you must listen to EVERY time you connect to a station. Awful feature.","I don't usually listen to the radio, however since I found and picked this App out, it has yet to let me down. As far as i can see, their is a varity of music and channels to pick from. I have yet to explore everything but 4 me this is perfect! Hope this App serves you well. TLAZCAMATI.","I like this app. Going on a few days now. I do wish we could type in the number channel we're looking for. Besides that, great radio app. Update - been a few months & this is my go to. Especially while I'm cleaning or showering. Picks up all stations, even my favorite locals... Radio stations have adds & commercials, duh. So please don't punish this app for that. Some of these young people have no idea what a radio station is. 😂","This is basically useless if you're not looking for a large radio station or if you don't have an exact frequency Edit in response to reply: I was trying to connect to my personal tv tower (transmits audio from my blu-ray via radio) and this just doesn't work for that since it's an imitation radio and not actually working off of radio frequencies. There's also not an option to test several frequencies at once if you don't know the exact frequency for pretty much the same reason."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.radio.fmradio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radio.fmradio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Pepi House: Happy Family","description":"Meet and greet the huge Pepi family in PEPI HOUSE!
