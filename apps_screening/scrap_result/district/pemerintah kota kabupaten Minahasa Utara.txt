Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask?

You buy the packs and so much of what you buy you never get. Fun game, but \"free play\" sadly isn't much fun as you can't compete and always lose everything when you can't afford shields.","This is a pay to win game. No matter how many free events there are you never going to get what is offered to people who pay. There are people with all over a billion power they will farm you. If you can't be on the game daily even free events aren't going to help. Plan to play for 3 years before you can compete and by then they will be even stronger. Maybe if you had just start up battlefields.","Tell you what, I watched the gameplay of this and I was sold! It looks like toystory meets call of duty!! I downloaded it instantly, looks great!!! Ill give It 5 stars until further notice. Remember, Xbox and Playstation controllers can connect to your android device, so you don't need the touch screen to play! Anymore :D","Well, I saw this game on an ad and I though \"Hey this looks interesting\" but when I actually installed it, it was NOTHING like the ad, it was one of those territory games, but the thing in the ad said that it was a Third Person shooter game like COD or Fortnite, but no it wasn't, talk about a rip-off. Anyways, it was a complete waste of time.","The game takes some time getting used to, however 9/10 times you're going to get attacked by someone three times stronger than you (most likely pays to win), so understanding how to get aegis and leveling up is paramount.

However, i have given it 4 stars because of a glitch that i do not know how to fix. I have made two custom characters, but I can only get one to appear at a time. one will appear, but when i edit the other one so it appears as well the first one vanishes, and can't be found under the stop sign menu. in addition, there are a lot, and i mean a lot of in app purchases, and there is almost nothing for free to play users.","Toca world is an Amazing game! It is full of imagination and creativity. It is a good game for children about the age 6-11. I have played Toca games for about 5 years now and I'm still not bored of it. For a start, when I first played Toca games I loved them! And so when Toca World came out I wanted to play it so bad because all the games were mixed together. For the positives, It doesn't have many ads at all. For the Negatives, you have to pay to expand your world which isn't much of a problem.","I love this app! And the new stuff! But this review Is not mine but is gonna be for my friend. She made a schoolhouse last night or something, Next day (which is today) everything disappeared... Some stuff are not available to get anymore :(. Like she lost the backpack from the gift which is not available anymore (I think?) I really wanna help her out but I dont know how. Soooooo the only way to fix this was telling it in a review! I dont know how you can help but... This was worth it ^_^","There are few complaints I need to make sure get patched. 1, I make 2 characters in the creator. As soon as I go to the floogle place, it only gives me only one character. 2. I put things on the walls, few seconds later it disappears also with other things it happens. Also, it won't let me open boxes. It's annoying because it's with my friend aswell.","I love this app and others do love it to but the only problem is, (why its only 4 stars) is it takes so long to load in the game for me, I have a samsung galaxy if that helps please make it load faster if you can and maybe add more houses? I think everyone would go bonkers if you added new houses and items and new hair styles and clothes, so sorry for only 4 stars but the loading could be better, but I look foreward to playing this game everyday!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tocaboca.tocalifeworld","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tocaboca.tocalifeworld&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Exploration Lite Craft","description":"An amazing infinite blocky open world to build, craft and explore.

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage.

Don't play ffxv.","You can play free to play but its made so that some items are only available for a limited time or never and if you miss them you have to wait until they are offered as a prize months later. The p2p players can gift others a catch up token which often includes things past the paywall which is nice. Its a war game much much more than a city building one. Tries to get you to spend $. And different pack offers based on spending tier.","This game is legitimate garbage. All it does is drag the final fantasy name through the mud. You try and play and just get one tapped by someone 2 levels above you since they love balancing to make players spend money. If you don't spend or know people who will help you by spending than you're not gonna go anywhere. The support, sorry \"support\" actually told me when I have issues its my fault. I asked about the scaling of their events. They said its only for high levels spend money. GG Greed","I give it 5 stars cause it has helped me thru very tough times. Being able to talk communicate and strategize with other players. Never experienced anything like it. I was able to stay out of trouble and to better my life at same time. We all experience difficulties on buying packs. But truthfully I'm seeing people that has not spent money are hardly any catch up to the rest of us that do spend regularly.This is why buying the empire boosts are a must.This is what makes you better. GOD bless","0/10 Would not recommend. Pros: If you don't value your time and money, Congratulations you are the target audience for this game. Cons: 1) A window pops-up every 10 seconds telling you to spend money and you can't tell it to go away for the day like some other games with a similar pop-up. 2) The game doesn't really have anything to do with FF. They just took a poorly made game and through-in some pngs of ffXV characters.

A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

I've recorded over 20 phone calls, with the audio bar moving, showing sound being recorded. I've just gone into every single one, and not one single phone call is recorded! Not even my own voice.

The app is easy to use, which is important. Lets me concentrate on what I'm doing, rather than on figuring out how to opperate and record. Really glad I blundered into it!","This is one of the absolute best apps I have ever downloaded. Whenever I have a thought or want to record something for posterity this does the trick. Sound quality is exceptional. The process to record and save is so simple and it keeps a record of each recording by date. Is easy to retrieve each recording and listen back to it along with the option of saving again or deleting. It's so nice to have an app that is effective and simple but so valuable. 10 stars.","Great app! Nearly everything about this app is perfect. Not taking anything away, its just that I have not yet learned all. Even the page that pops up and asks for a rating is very pleasant which willingly carried me here.. This should be the app that comes with android. Nice work!","I'm a journalist, and this is the only recording app thus far that doesn't spontaneously delete my recordings. Saves audio automatically, and tells you how much recordable time you have left, which is a huge plus especially when I have a long event. Plus, it's free and ads don't play as soon as you stop recording. Love this app, I've recommended it to everyone I work with. Great job.","I haven't listened to all of my possible legal recordings yet, but I have tested things prior, and everything seemed good. Free and very handy when in sticky situations. 1+ months in using this app, so far so good. A minor few glitches when recording, but phone notification dings when there's an issue, not a big deal as long as you hear the notification and restart the recording. Easy to backup with phone cable to computer (just copy/cut and paste)! 12:55am July 25, 2021."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coffeebeanventures.easyvoicerecorder","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coffeebeanventures.easyvoicerecorder&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Gangstar New Orleans OpenWorld","description":"The gold standard for open-world action games is back, this time in the fascinating city of New Orleans.

It can get slow sometimes if you aren't willing to pay to play. But you can watch a bunch of ads to get diamonds and energy some of the time. My biggest issue is how long it takes to open spirit jars. Some take 12 hours. It makes it hard to level up and get upgrades. If all your slots are full, you can't get new jars when you complete new missions. So you just have to wait or miss out.","I didn't rated 5 star because of the energy system, I need to watch ads before doing the task when I no have enough energy. Beside that, I think this game not have many functions, example:sit, eat, drink, jump and phone.Whatever,I played this game already one year,I think this game have a nice graphics👍 and a large map, a great effect .maybe this game can't even good than gta5,but I still think this is my most favorite open world mobile game.","The game is better than I thought. The game is nice and great especially the free roam part. I gave it only four stars because you can't put away ur weapon as far as I know, you can crouch, you can't jump bc there's no button for it and there's no way to be sneaky or stealthy bc once u shoot or kill a cop, they know where your location is even if they didn't see you. As far as I know, u can't change the radio either. I would still recommend and play this game tho.","Great game, beyond my expectations. It's graphics is simply awesome. And very addictive. Very missions are nail biting thrills will never take your eyes from it . Recommend to all , especially for action pack lovers instead of playing free fire and call of duty, play this extraordinary game. It's my honest review . Love this game very much.","The game is really interesting has really nice resolution for a mobile game and it is really fun but the only downfall is the story it's a bit shorter than expected and I personally think that you could do an expansion on the map Idk like adding 12 more turfs would be more interesting and fun you could also add that u can buy more island's but I have a grether idea 💡 but I don't know how would it preform it could be more than 12 GB just call it gangster USA my insta for info 1david.radivojevic1"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftOLHM","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftOLHM&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Creative Destruction","description":"Creative Destruction is a sandbox survival game that features the utmost fun of building and firing. \r\n\r\nIn the mood for a heart-stirring showdown?

I played it everyday! But recently, there has been some issues when I'm trying to log in. Everytime I try to get into the app it always says ' There has been an error while downloading. Please restart or reinstall the game '. I honestly don't know why its doing this, and I don't wanna uninstall it bc I've worked so hard on this game. Please fix this if you can, I'd appreciate it a lot!! Thank u","This game is something else 😁 I've of course have played it since season one and till now the game has come a long way!!! If you have a older device or whatever technology you play on is old the game will run a bit slower😐 however I haven't experienced any bugs or game crashes. The hackers are next to minimum but There are non in my years of playing. The community is great and if you are going to invest any money into it you won't regret it surprisingly. TOTALLY RECOMMEND TO PLAY!!","My old account uses facebook to login and whenever I try to log in with it, it says \"error\"... Why? I know I'm using the correct facebook account because I checked. Please fix it. I don't want to start over, otherwise I'll have to uninstall.","I just wanted to let the creative destruction players know that the game support took all of my son's skins, weapons etc. There was a problem purchasing a gem pack last week. I asked for a refund however creative destruction took all of his previously purchased items. My son is autistic and doesn't understand why this is being done. I tried to explain to game support however they state he need repurchase all of his items.

The different game modes are awesome, and the reward system is generous. The Hero/Villain Roster is amazing! I was playing SW:GOH, for years and the developers ended up ruining the game over the years. They focused more on making money rather than keeping it fun. The rewards became very slim. But, if this games stays the way it is with great reward drops, and fairly priced in-game purchases, I'll play this game everyday, and I'll gladly recommend it to everyone I can.","Amazing game. Is not a money grab like the avengers game. It be cool if they can bring some new cools updates. Such as Allowing to invite random people to an alliance. Able to join a random alliance. Heroic mode cost a lot of energy so there a limit of how much you can play. Overall is an amazing game. But the game might need more funding and cool features to get more players Still derseve 5 starts","Been playing for 4 years or more daily (absolutely love it). Best mobile game to date. Very in depth rpg system. Every battle can be different with tons of different play styles. We'll over a 100 characters maybe even nearing 200 now. You can play this game daily for 10 minutes or a few hours to get daily challenges it's all up to you. Or you can play in few minute increments if your a busy worker. Not pay to win, paying only helps you boost a little faster but not necessary. Favorite game!","Great game, especially for beginners, but the grind is made too long and most characters become useful only after certain Legendary Skills have been unlocked, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money very early on you won't have these abilities that make most characters good, also energy goes way too fast, and instead of having a node be playable without recharging it 3 times make it 5, a too hardcore grind right off the bat will make some players quit the game","I've been playing faithfully for three years, got all the characters, was really strong, then they go and add one character (Black Flash) that makes it where you can't do anything and die every single time. It was great until they added that character. TONE DOWN BLACK FLASH SO WE CAN DO PLAY INSTEAD OF ALL CHARACTERS BEING DEFEATED BEFORE WE CAN EVEN DO ONE ATTACK!!!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.wb.goog.dc.legends","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.dc.legends&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Gangstar Vegas: World of Crime","description":"Gangstar Vegas is a role-playing game to become the leader of a gang in Las Vegas, while playing along gangsters and mafia cartels, in a free open game world with gang wars.\r\n\r\nV IS FOR LAS VEGAS: THE CITY OF SIN\r\nExplore this open city with different TPS missions, box the mafia cartel, fight for the final prize and play in different adventure crime clans vs. the gang world of the city of Las Vegas.\r\nThis is an RPG adventure saga of mafia and waging gang wars.

Everything is in idiot mode. You steal a high value car but instead of them chasing you, you instantly have tanks and helicopters trying to kill you.
