How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home.

But there are some things that needs fixing. New App icons are still loaded on the homepage even though it's selected that they not be loaded. Apps at when you open them gets the icons loaded on the homepages. Sometimes when Apps are loaded on the homepage you can't remove them. Also I'm using your galaxy star wallpaper that came with the launcher. I have added additional homepages but the galaxy patterns that are on the original 3 pages will not extend to the others.","I don't want this app taking over my phone. I just wanted my keyboard back when it disappeared after an update. This sucks!!!!! Then the stupid thing didn't even work!!","Only issue i have with it is it crashes like 6 or more times a day and refreshes some times i have to go and testart the app for my homescreen and select always. It's extreamly annoying. Otherwuse i would give it 5 stars. And there is hardly ever new theams","This launcher constantly messes up your phone every time u get off a social media, it goes live like live wall paper deliberately stating loading resources...then deliberately takes 5 minutes to load your apps onto the screen like it knows it's harassing the phone owner so this launcher continues to do it. It's irritating & needs to stop doing it.","UPDATE: Got tired of all of the popups using my system resources! Switched to CMM Launcher! No BLOATWARE! Great themes. 100% improvement. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Program installs annoying app (without permission) called BOOST. This app has annoying pop-ups asking to \"fix\" your phone and can't be disabled! Also, there is no provision to backup your configuration. Otherwise it is a good launcher with many themes & wallpapers.

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Waplog - Dating App to Chat & Meet New People","description":"Waplog Dating App\r\n\r\nThe fastest-growing dating app with more than 90 million users worldwide.

A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good.

I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static. Still, it's great for people who use wired headphones. I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","The app work fine but when you quit an app it's notification keeps persistent for a couple of seconds.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going.

I should be able to at least decide not to use the functionality. Second, stop putting ads on the app everywhere.

Be could be hours playing (of course I didn't let him). Until they started putting ads. Now I'll uninstall since he will press anything and can't play this like this anymore. Bye and thanks for the fun times.","This game at first seems boring. But, yes, it's for children and they're amused by anything. And yes, they do learn stuff so that's good. Until you click the red circle and it shows those 3 ladybugs dancing. Now im not a hype man, but that was the best thing I've ever seen. Which gives this review it's rating. Best game out of all of them so far.","The game is good but my problem is that we can't call a gorilla and a wolf so can you make it better please? Thanks Gokids.
