How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home. So, instead of just opening the tracker in another browser tab, the developers in their infinite wisdom have decided that it is better if you unlock your phone, open the app, and then be able to locate.

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"World Building Craft","description":"World Building Craft is #1 sandbox block world crafting simulator.

It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say.

Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids\r\n\r\nA safer online experience for kids\r\nWe work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\r\n\r\nCustomize your child’s experience with Parental Controls\r\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\r\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.\r\nBlocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.\r\nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\r\n\r\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\r\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”. \r\n\r\nSelect the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts.

Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids<br><br><b>A safer online experience for kids</b><br>We work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.<br><br><b>Customize your child’s experience with Parental Controls<br>Limit screen time:</b> Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.<br><b>Keep up with what they watch:</b> Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.<br><b>Blocking:</b> Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.<br><b>Flagging:</b> You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<br><br><b>Create individual experiences as unique as your kids</b><br>Create up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”. <br><br>Select the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts.

As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Airport City - transport manager","description":"Airport games are a true adventure, and Airport City is among the best!

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently.

I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static. Still, it's great for people who use wired headphones. I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","The app work fine but when you quit an app it's notification keeps persistent for a couple of seconds. The app doesn't look very modern, it looks like it's from 2010. The app keep removing the names of radio stations I saved. So please fix it.

The only downside is it is quite quirky and I lost two purchases that amounted to over $40 because I was changing screens too quickly they say. I have no proof so I'm out my money but the game is awesome just needs work on how it runs.","I think the game is great. Its fun and keeps me fairly preoccupied. The biggest issue I have with this game is the customer service. I spend more than my fair share purchasing game packs. The one time I had an issue with mafia city's system updates, I reached out and all I hear were excuses as to why theh are unable to give me back the gold I purchased (by the way).","Just another city builder/resource management sim, but with a \"mafia\" theme. Nothing like the ads you've seen. Pushy with microtransactions but definitely not the worst I've experienced. The audio quality is awful and the art style is nothing special. My #1 gripe is when games like this block you from the 2nd building slot with no way to unlock other than spending real money, such is the case here. If you're actually into this style of game you can find much better elsewhere.","So far so good. Have not experienced any serious issues. I will see how much of a Pay 2 Win gane this is, though I am hoping it won't be too bad. Graphics are good and the artwork and design of various characters are well done. Put in more action into this game and I will raise my rating to 5 stars.","Very bad. Train troops for months and wipe out in few hours by other stronger rich players that spend with money. Not a game for those that does not want to spend money at all. Stop wasting your time. Find other games that required skill much better"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.yottagames.mafiawar","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yottagames.mafiawar&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Waplog - Dating App to Chat & Meet New People","description":"Waplog Dating App\r\n\r\nThe fastest-growing dating app with more than 90 million users worldwide.

In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game.","I love this game so much! My sister always play this everyday. Also I was wondering if you can add more characters that look like cartoons or movies games like FNaF and your style.thank you!","The game is useless you can't even get out the respawn area at all u can't even move hardly update ur game so pepole can actually play without any issues remove the ads the game is horrible you can't even get out the respawn area at all u don't even have half the stuff needed for the game it should not be on play store no flints for the tnt and no pickaxe nothing its terrible I do not recommend downloading the game because its useless","So far it's a pretty good game, runs smoothly in multiplayer for me. I have actual minecraft so I usually only play this with a friend who doesn't. Creative mode is pretty good so far but hasn't been updated in ages. Could you add more blocks? For example, stairs, rods, signs, animal spawn eggs, and more. Oh, the ability to place trap doors lower would be a nice addition. Also could it be possible for pressure plates, sticky pistons, honey blocks, and redstone to be added in, in the future?"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Babyphone - baby music games with Animals, Numbers","description":"Educational animal games for preschoolers - baby phone.\r\nBaby games Phone for Kids is one of our baby educational games for kids  which entertains babies and helps them learn 123 numbers, animals and sounds for babies.
