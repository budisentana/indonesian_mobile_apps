There was no signal or network. Only GPS app was with us. Finally we are safe and reached home. Thank you very much.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features.

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little. But they slowed the car like WAY too much."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rkgames.smashywanted","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rkgames.smashywanted&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"ooVoo Video Calls, Messaging & Stories","description":"ooVoo Free High-Quality Video Calling, Messaging and Collaborative Stories: Keeping you connected with the people who matter most!

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles.

Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a üîê screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income.

Also began directing me in different directions including making a u turn while on a highway. This on a route I have taken multiple times in the past. I uninstalled and reinstalled. It worked fine on a couple of trips then went haywire again. very frustrating","Often it will spend a long time searching for alternate routes but only show me the original (no others to select). I will keep trying to see if it refreshed only to get the same result. This will go on for several minutes. This typically happens on my usual commute home from work. I never take the original way it intends but it never recalls the route I end up using.","It's consistently works & I have the ability to ignore when needed. However recently the app has been loosing direction when travel & will CONSTANTLY change mid drive. This is bad for rideshare if you're not familiar with the area, app is updated with space on phone & SD card (1.2gb used, 119gb left. Galaxy J3 3rd gen 16gb. App works on other phones in house fine, but this is a basic problem.","My favorite app. Wish it was a bit more descriptive like which Lane I need to get in Or if I can add things to the map to help me in the future. Or to add which route I would take automatically (like a preferred route) for places I always go. Like work and home and only adjust if there is construction or an accident that would be nice. Sometimes it doesn't connect to Spotify as well as I would like. Takes forever to load when first opening. Voice cntl would be nice too. Thank you.","I've been using the Waze app for about 5 years now and I really like it although I was using an older version 4.68.0.1 due to bugs in other versions.

And then lose, and then have to wait and scrounge all over again until I can play another game of bingo. So thats why no 5 stars.","I'm slightly addicted. Not enough to spend money, but enough to play outside of rewarded play time. I only discovered it through a rewarded play app, trying to win money, not spend it. But, it's a great bingo game. There are many, many fun extras, there's definitely more than meets the eye. There's also a nice variety of ways to earn extra credits but when you're slightly addicted you run through those quickly. All in all, one of the best free bingo apps I've played.","This is my favorite Bingo game. It doesn't get boring but I do think they should give more free chips per day or lower the chips you have to pay per card. I can only play like 3 games per day since I can't afford to spend money on it. I might would spend a few dollars a day if it wasn't so expensive. I think the chips are way to high of a price.","There are so many Bingo apps out that it's hard to choose one. I absolutely love Bingo Bash. (The only other one that is on the same level of fun, for me, is Bingo Pop.) I've leveled up & I'm playing in fun rooms, and contests. My problem is I can never play more than a couple games per day without spending IRL money. Now that I've done that 2x, the prices for a handful of chips soared. I don't win like I did at first either. UPDATE: Since passing level 25, the entire game has changed. 5 stars!","Terrible! You pay for premium cards and still can't win. What a waste! The same people win again and again. The numbers don't make sense that with that many players the same ones win all the time. Also, they need more bingos per game. Is there anything you can buy with all these stupid coins, you should be able to buy bingo chips with them like you can in some other games. The bingos might be randomly called but the SAME PLAYERS keep winning. Even with FOUR PREMIUM cards you can't win."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"air.com.bitrhymes.bingo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.bitrhymes.bingo&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"DataKu : Cek Data Nomor KTP dan NPWP","description":"Dataku ini berfungsi untuk pengecekan data seperti data kependudukan yang ada pada KTP dan data yang ada pada NPWP.\r\nSelain itu terdapat fitur tambahan berupa : \r\n- Informasi Usia\r\n- Informasi Generasi Kelahiran\r\n- Informasi Zodiak\r\n- Fitur Simpan Data\r\n\r\nSumber data yang ditampilkan didapat dari data rekapitulasi yang ada pada situs kpu.go.id beserta data hasil pembacaan Nomor NIK maupun Nomor NPWP dan dikombinasikan dengan teknologi dari sumber-sumber yang ada pada server kami.\r\n\r\nAplikasi DataKu ini juga tidak mewakili entitas pemerintah, organisasi ataupun parpol manapun.","descriptionHTML":"Dataku ini berfungsi untuk pengecekan data seperti data kependudukan yang ada pada KTP dan data yang ada pada NPWP.<br>Selain itu terdapat fitur tambahan berupa : <br>- Informasi Usia<br>- Informasi Generasi Kelahiran<br>- Informasi Zodiak<br>- Fitur Simpan Data<br><br>Sumber data yang ditampilkan didapat dari data rekapitulasi yang ada pada situs kpu.go.id beserta data hasil pembacaan Nomor NIK maupun Nomor NPWP dan dikombinasikan dengan teknologi dari sumber-sumber yang ada pada server kami.<br><br>Aplikasi DataKu ini juga tidak mewakili entitas pemerintah, organisasi ataupun parpol manapun.","summary":"Check the Number Data on the KTP Card and NPWP.","installs":"100,000+","minInstalls":100000,"maxInstalls":138322,"score":4.1006494,"scoreText":"4.1","ratings":6116,"reviews":1172,"histogram":{"1":814,"2":238,"3":466,"4":595,"5":4001},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"5.1M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"S1Creative","developerId":"S1Creative","developerEmail":"match.id94@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"https://s1creative.com","privacyPolicy":"https://s1creative.com/app/priv/dataku","developerInternalID":"8020873439779672274","genre":"Tools","genreId":"TOOLS","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5i-WgryQQX2NaAJJpo6uFbHhnkyUzuUAPWlWW2H0_a6JEeJrEtbYYnq5YdSjaj2URtY","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Hd6ShGObv5pIfVZ-okkfwJHViT3XMQY4Gg2aCfAgLSnqNvlGieZukgLp4u5Xz_J2KUw","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uB_SPQlf1nUsWTLkgu1Xkck2vACYapcOKHuCRQo5UCddVYD1QorDQMz2MZt14X5bTw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EwjR5iEKZiM6UPPvLU8IleV0CCDuRMqpTc9LFIiGXGrgJs2_xvZ5vKNT0vB8QsktPOU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0c40E9ahLM_pz7NHviGtPTOh3cUON8j_DTtqmSoTcuL-0rmGiHsGSXTqavbS29J-Sw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2wX1FWrTY4MkJ9CZ7o-xvoZxlDHkgaoKl_RjBcC1YA48cnd1S2KcnWogOF-n9NBZyQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xQsTQ6Kq3nwqMuz2mYYFhGLIN5f1bCJcr44aNIberyBSYCo85qZp5LNJxHt2Xz52rQE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vf56nUePENWjhGzUss-MXP4YDUdbeW36_QQ8JUazJ6ezRYW6IKCMquVKpToRWrWQsw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/szoExSfX5VvynR-t5qZk0RE9DktiBD-_1kYQM7-mVBcUOmRPrQgypIZvnCt5C8KvAA"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Dec 4, 2020","updated":1623043399000,"version":"1.28.52","recentChanges":"Cek DataKu ini berfungsi untuk mengecek data-data kependudukan dan npwp.<br><br>Update : <br>- Perbaikan beberapa Bug,<br>- Perbaikan Force Close pada beberapa perangkat.<br>- Perbaikan Halaman Kebijakan Privasi.","comments":["Bad apps.
