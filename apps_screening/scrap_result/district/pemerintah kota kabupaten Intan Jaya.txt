I'd probably had one to many, installed it and forgot overnight. I hate to admit that I thought it was malware intrusion. I love the app. I was looking for an aftn mirroring app and bingo Play Store showed a list, INSTALLED. I like the updates, didn't know I could push right or left to see more.

It was convenient that way, and it would be great if we could have that option at least, possibly being able to change in settings the set up. Update 6/9/21: it's a lot harder to peek at the screen/have everything show up when glancing at my phone.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much! Saying that the local news I receive is great and helps keep me up-to-date!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.particlenews.newsbreak","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.particlenews.newsbreak&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"India News, Latest News App, Live News Headlines","description":"NewsPoint is a news app that presents the latest news in crisp format from trusted national and international publishers.

Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.)

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going.

This release brings bug fixes that improve our product to help you discover new places and navigate to them.<br><br>Become a beta tester: http://goo.gl/vLUcaJ","comments":["This app helps me a lot, getting from point A, to point B. It has minor issues of real time. Street view doesn't always work, even after I previously did a street view of that location. This app would be perfect if I could program my own route. I'm an escort (Pilot car) for oversize loads. We have routes issued to us by the states and counties. Plus, sometimes I don't like the route, google maps offers. One last thing, I wish we could switch to satellite view AFTER we hit \"start\". Thank you!","For quite a while I couldn't get voiced notifications. So, I decided to \"Google\" it. It said, delete cache and data. It seemed to work fine. I have just done an 8.5 hour journey that should have taken 5.5 hours. No fault of Google obviously. However, 3/4 of the way through the trip, the notifications stopped. Then 30 minutes before our journey end the voiced notifications packed up. If this does not alter I'll try 'Waze', it looks a much better option.","Never uses the most direct or fastest route. I entered my destination and it said it would take 1 hour and 40 minutes on the fastest of the 3 options of routes it gave me, which I knew was way off. I used another navigation app and reached my destination in 50 minutes. Other times it has taken me off the beaten path in an unfamiliar city and through some very bad neighborhoods when I could have stayed on the interstate and reached my destination much, much faster and safer. Do not recommend.","This application is always inaccurate with time tracking. It also makes serious errors which make the driver lost. It also makes it hard to see future directions. When it does a good job it is excellent but when it doesn't it is highly frustrating. The app made a mistake and said Jefferson hwy was Jefferson heights and kept sending me to the wrong location. It also gets lost in the French quarter. It is frustrating and can cause loss of employment and lost time in one's life.","Maps has not been working properly for me for the past month! It won't load the map and when getting directions, it wants me to take the longest, most ridiculous route to get to my destination. It also loses signal often and gets lost, or will tell me to turn at the very last minute causing me to miss turns. Please make an update for this app to correct itself!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.maps","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"AI Gallery","description":"Brand new AIGallery, faster and lighter.\r\n\r\n📱  Main function\r\n\r\n📷   Reorganize the homepage: Easy to select photos you need on homepage.\r\n🏎   Efficient album classification: Orderly classification of album.\r\n🖼   Multi-template puzzles: Rich puzzle templates to customize photo puzzles as you like.\r\n🖌   Picture editing: Complete picture editing ability.\r\n🧹   Photo Cleanup: Clean up too dark, blurry, duplicate photos, no longer taking up space.\r\n🗞   Photo compression: Hd lossless compression & leave more storage for your phone.\r\n\r\n📱   Other functions\r\n\r\n🌟   Dark mode.\r\n🌟   Picture slideshow.\r\n🌟   Easy to share pictures to social media or anywhere else.\r\n🌟   Show photo and video details.\r\n🌟   Set any picture as your desktop wallpaper.\r\n🌟   Easily zoom photos with gestures.\r\n🌟   Picture slideshow.\r\n🌟   Create an album.","descriptionHTML":"Brand new AIGallery, faster and lighter.<br><br>📱  Main function<br><br>📷   Reorganize the homepage: Easy to select photos you need on homepage.<br>🏎   Efficient album classification: Orderly classification of album.<br>🖼   Multi-template puzzles: Rich puzzle templates to customize photo puzzles as you like.<br>🖌   Picture editing: Complete picture editing ability.<br>🧹   Photo Cleanup: Clean up too dark, blurry, duplicate photos, no longer taking up space.<br>🗞   Photo compression: Hd lossless compression &amp; leave more storage for your phone.<br><br>📱   Other functions<br><br>🌟   Dark mode.<br>🌟   Picture slideshow.<br>🌟   Easy to share pictures to social media or anywhere else.<br>🌟   Show photo and video details.<br>🌟   Set any picture as your desktop wallpaper.<br>🌟   Easily zoom photos with gestures.<br>🌟   Picture slideshow.<br>🌟   Create an album.","summary":"Simple and fast without ads","installs":"100,000,000+","minInstalls":100000000,"maxInstalls":147068420,"score":4.205128,"scoreText":"4.2","ratings":57885,"reviews":10016,"histogram":{"1":7619,"2":1909,"3":2552,"4":4700,"5":41103},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"43M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"Transsion Holdings","developerId":"Transsion+Holdings","developerEmail":"chang.shu@transsion.com","privacyPolicy":"http://cdn.shalltry.com/transhold/en1/policy","developerInternalID":"6213149559220580442","genre":"Photography","genreId":"PHOTOGRAPHY","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mlR3AHmDvRYxBLf2Vwr8gy6C7wU6Uj9JrudQ2tUT9JrYbLL0zDiPBszvArZmPgNYUwM","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8vvBpPEncpqWv9TtOawb7YPZpfn_XHA-ZbjKUJDvLiZUX0aocC67a5NR1D1KLPd5k-w2","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OxDB6svQOgCxwJLTnRl1syR8WaEysSApLzD44YsTISSC24Ms5RANYDTxgXxzzPOOL_U","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4SybNzpUPmX7uUDq1bbMuzfI9E4Rj10nQZ5YoiEN5lkjmV26OrTb6-t3x7Iy5lgUNg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AdULU0h6G32kBRDlQ_laU-7og_TTHX4GesOIGgOrVqmZXmDxF3ncW-LAluYv3JMxaV6E","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KLLzMXsQOtdYfl8drylrgpyiz-_z6urskI3WJeeARygS5YTXHVna4VdGO3tkye3sYwc"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Aug 15, 2018","updated":1602845478000,"version":"4.5.0.3","recentChanges":"New UI appearance and two new features!<br>1.

Kindly see to these issues.","I would like this application but it seems that it have some mis-technical arrangements. This application doesn't show any photos in it. Every time I have a snapshot that i usually had, it disappears after some minutes. Why I don't know please guys try to fix this or I will disable it immediately. It really frustrating me guys/creators of this application.","I truly love this app but the thing which I hate the most is that, it can't play videos properly... Like if I'm playing a video, it jumps several seconds ahead. And no matter how hard you try, the video doesn't even start from behind.. And there is a problem of watching videos like you have to Click to watch the video first and if you want to watch the next video, YOU CAN'T SWIPE, you have to back up first and then click the VERY next video to watch. STRANGE!!!","I love the app and I've been using it for long, but it suddenly went off my screen, and it's no longer on the phone, to view the app I'd have to go to play store to open from there. Please I will like to open the app from my phone desktop. Thank you.","I'm really wondering how on earth this scored 100M downloads? To be quite honest, it is the sole reason that I tried it myself;. So perhaps you've literally just gotten lucky all the way up past 100M?

With a new set of songs each Wednesday, there is always more to explore. ","comments":["This is the first (and only) music app I have ever used. And my GOD what a choice of songs. YouTube Music must have every song 🎵 in the world!! And eventually if you hit the like button often enough they will create a list of just your favorite songs/videos. I pay for YouTube premium and I'm sure that's why I don't get any ads at all. I'm very 😊 happy with YouTube Music so far.","This app is alright. I have premium, so I can't comment of the ads. The functions for listening to songs are quite good. However, ocationaly on songs it will say they are from a different artist, or play a song to what it says and what the album cover is. For example, when I went into thefatrat's \"Rise up\" it played a song called solitude instead. This was later fixed, however, if I go to the song, \"Kings and Queens Part two\" by Ava Max, it will sometimes play the wrong song.","The radio option is the only thing I really don't like about it. When you selected \"radio\" on an artist in Google play music it played songs that were from similar artists. YTM however, seems to play songs from artists that you've listened to a lot. Example: Hit the radio button on a power metal artist and the radio starts playing a bunch of TOOL because I've listened to them a lot and it really doesn't fit at all, especially when I'm using it to explore other artists in the power metal genre.","Not fit for purpose. I've been trying to work with this junk since launch. Spent months creating 12 playlists across 12 genres, totalling 9,170 tracks to listen to my playlists across my 7 Google hub max speakers. However, regardless of what playlist you select, even on shuffle, it will always start off playing the first track. It will then continue to play the same 20 or 30 tracks over and over again all day long even when playlist has over 1000 tracks. Switched to Spotify yesterday, heaven!!","I enjoy using the app. It creates several Mixes for you from different genres & eras that you listen to so you can choose what you're in the mood for. Every Wednesday there's a Discover Mix which I love. It's a mix of music they think you'll like based on your music choices. I'd give it 5 stars, but they took away the tab that used to drop down with your task bar. That was great bc you could skip through songs without leaving the app you're currently in.

With a great interface, nice preference options, and new tabs for special issues (Elections, COVID, Olympics, etc.). I find the issue of ads overblown, and are fairly limited. Overall, this app is definitely worth it for those looking for diverse news.","I've used this app for years now, and I've liked it a lot. Ads are getting way too intrusive now, they're injecting ads into every news story that you open, On the main feeds after every three news articles was an ad, and with the latest update the ads are now showing large graphics. And also when you open the story and then try and exit ads are popping up, and in some cases prompting you to install software which is dangerous as hell. Just about at the end of my rope with this app.","Love the app, it's great for getting news from a lot of different sources. Recently updated and had to ability to pick topics I am interested in. Only reason its 4 and not 5 stars is I wish you could also pick news I don't want to see. Like I see WAY too many articles by news sites that are extremely biased (uber left or right), just wish there was a way to filter certain sites out.","Used to be a great news resource. Now it's littered with ads that you can not back out of. You have to completely close the app! Each article is just packed full of ads; it's hard to read the article itself! The \"top\" news source that is forced on you is where a lot of the ads are too! You can customize other interests but you have to navigate between the article itself and the annoying ads. Time to look for a new news app!","I've had this app for quite a while. I like it alot. Format is good. Recently, it's getting glitchy. I keep reinstalling it in hopes of improved performance. Hasn't helped. I have a pixel 3a. It's a strong phone so I don't think it's my phone. Good luck with bugs. Good site otherwise. I must add I agree with others that ads are killing it. I don't mind some but video ads and page block adds don't cut it.
