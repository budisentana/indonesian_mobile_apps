So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GO Music - Offline & online music, free MV, MP3","description":"Enjoy online & offline music streaming of millions of trending songs on demand.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going.

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too.

If you solve this problem then there to nothing to say any negative point of this application. Thanks.","The ads make this app very creepy. Like you are such an invasive friend and a terrible one if you use this app to check on your friends when they say \"oh battery's dead\" or something. That's creepy. Plus half the things you say in the ad doesn't make sense. Any way you advertise this app is just gonna make it look creepy and kinda stalkerish. Other than that, your replys to most of these reviews are quite nice.","Zenly is a very cool app. I used it every day. After that, I updated the firmware version and now it does not work ...

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Block City Wars: Pixel Shooter with Battle Royale","description":"5..4..3..2..1..

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

The only downside is it is quite quirky and I lost two purchases that amounted to over $40 because I was changing screens too quickly they say. I have no proof so I'm out my money but the game is awesome just needs work on how it runs.","I think the game is great. Its fun and keeps me fairly preoccupied. The biggest issue I have with this game is the customer service. I spend more than my fair share purchasing game packs. The one time I had an issue with mafia city's system updates, I reached out and all I hear were excuses as to why theh are unable to give me back the gold I purchased (by the way).","Just another city builder/resource management sim, but with a \"mafia\" theme. Nothing like the ads you've seen. Pushy with microtransactions but definitely not the worst I've experienced. The audio quality is awful and the art style is nothing special. My #1 gripe is when games like this block you from the 2nd building slot with no way to unlock other than spending real money, such is the case here. If you're actually into this style of game you can find much better elsewhere.","So far so good. Have not experienced any serious issues. I will see how much of a Pay 2 Win gane this is, though I am hoping it won't be too bad. Graphics are good and the artwork and design of various characters are well done.

This release brings bug fixes that improve our product to help you discover new places and navigate to them.<br><br>Become a beta tester: http://goo.gl/vLUcaJ","comments":["This app helps me a lot, getting from point A, to point B. It has minor issues of real time. Street view doesn't always work, even after I previously did a street view of that location. This app would be perfect if I could program my own route. I'm an escort (Pilot car) for oversize loads. We have routes issued to us by the states and counties. Plus, sometimes I don't like the route, google maps offers. One last thing, I wish we could switch to satellite view AFTER we hit \"start\". Thank you!","Never uses the most direct or fastest route. I entered my destination and it said it would take 1 hour and 40 minutes on the fastest of the 3 options of routes it gave me, which I knew was way off. I used another navigation app and reached my destination in 50 minutes. Other times it has taken me off the beaten path in an unfamiliar city and through some very bad neighborhoods when I could have stayed on the interstate and reached my destination much, much faster and safer. Do not recommend.","This application is always inaccurate with time tracking. It also makes serious errors which make the driver lost. It also makes it hard to see future directions. When it does a good job it is excellent but when it doesn't it is highly frustrating. The app made a mistake and said Jefferson hwy was Jefferson heights and kept sending me to the wrong location. It also gets lost in the French quarter. It is frustrating and can cause loss of employment and lost time in one's life.","Maps has not been working properly for me for the past month!

And then lose, and then have to wait and scrounge all over again until I can play another game of bingo. So thats why no 5 stars.","I'm slightly addicted. Not enough to spend money, but enough to play outside of rewarded play time. I only discovered it through a rewarded play app, trying to win money, not spend it. But, it's a great bingo game. There are many, many fun extras, there's definitely more than meets the eye. There's also a nice variety of ways to earn extra credits but when you're slightly addicted you run through those quickly. All in all, one of the best free bingo apps I've played.","This is my favorite Bingo game. It doesn't get boring but I do think they should give more free chips per day or lower the chips you have to pay per card. I can only play like 3 games per day since I can't afford to spend money on it. I might would spend a few dollars a day if it wasn't so expensive. I think the chips are way to high of a price.","There are so many Bingo apps out that it's hard to choose one. I absolutely love Bingo Bash. (The only other one that is on the same level of fun, for me, is Bingo Pop.) I've leveled up & I'm playing in fun rooms, and contests. My problem is I can never play more than a couple games per day without spending IRL money. Now that I've done that 2x, the prices for a handful of chips soared. I don't win like I did at first either. UPDATE: Since passing level 25, the entire game has changed. 5 stars!","Terrible! You pay for premium cards and still can't win. What a waste! The same people win again and again. The numbers don't make sense that with that many players the same ones win all the time. Also, they need more bingos per game. Is there anything you can buy with all these stupid coins, you should be able to buy bingo chips with them like you can in some other games. The bingos might be randomly called but the SAME PLAYERS keep winning. Even with FOUR PREMIUM cards you can't win."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"air.com.bitrhymes.bingo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.bitrhymes.bingo&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"YP - The Real Yellow Pages","description":"YP – the even-more-powerful Yellow Pages, helps you connect instantly with great local businesses.

Unfortunately, I paid for the ad removal.","This app has multiple problems 1. Needs wifi to find current location; why doesn't it use GPS signal 2. System is set to 'Imperial'; but distance is displayed in 'km'. I want to know that I have 1 mile to my next turn instead of 1.6km I paid for this app but not getting the use that I expected. Don't buy this app until these problems are fixed.","Totally disappointed. All I get is adds, can't even get a simple route without continuous adds. Can't drive and close adds at the same time. Going g back to Rand McNally.","Privacy practices seems questionable. Definitely do not want to trust the app. This could be clear from the privacy information in the app, just one needs to go through. Not sure why developer is wanting to send an email, when they could change the information collection on the app. I dont feel comfortable using the app at all.","Takes forever just to load the maps in navigation, takes a long time just to find my location, weather forecast is only for the present time, seems very clunky."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.maps.voice.navigation.traffic.gps.location.route.driving.directions","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maps.voice.navigation.traffic.gps.location.route.driving.directions&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Geometry Dash World","description":"Geometry Dash is back with a brand new adventure!

I get chests everyday , I have 1000 diamonds and I also like my daily levels , the reason I love this game is because I get to have featured levels , quests and all for free! That 150 130 gem thing must be a bug. I have also completed half of the featured levels and 5 daily levels. And 82 things like icons , ships ,balls , ufos , waves , robots, spiders , trails , death effects and colors. This one is a little bit better than geometry dash (but not full version) so,yeah!","This game is amazing, theres alot of things to do and its very fun. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because everytime I get diamonds from quests something weird happens. Everytime I leave and come back for some reason I start to loose my diamonds. I used to have 150 diamonds but now I have 130. It's very wierd and annoying but although of that this games is good!","It has amazing music and the obstacles are abstract and colourful, the beat matches every obstacle as well. It's an amazing game, and I recommend it to those who have fast fingers and like electronic music. I have no complaints about this game, so it earns a five-star rating from me. If at First You Don't Succeed, try, try again.","I completed gd world in just 1 attempt, super fun and colorful, different varieties of icons, colors, online+daily lvls, perfect sync, lots of things to collect and most definitely great soundtracks! (in my case I don't get many ads) but there are only 10 lvls and freaking short. Want rob to add more lvls. Anyways, Def 5 stars and suggested to download this app!","I love this app so much.I just dont understand why it just stops working sometimes?When ads come i always click on them and then i go to google play and get back to the game,but sometimes it yeets me to my browser???I dont get why that happens but im on redmi note 8T and i hope thatll be fixed soon.When i enter the app sometimes,Its just a black screen with lighter fazes if grey,and it doesnt work until i reset my phone.Please fix these bugs!!😔💓"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.robtopx.geometrydashworld","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robtopx.geometrydashworld&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

And im not rich to pay a online money... We dont even have credit card.... Please to the people who make this game please remake it good ☺☺","These types of games are really fun for my younger sister! She really likes the fact that you can unlock the whole thing by watching an ad for 15 minutes, but sometimes when something drops on the floor it glitches and you can hardly pick it up. Please fix that bug then I can give you 5 stars 😊","I like this game but to unlock other floors... I CAN'T BUY THE HOLE SET with online money. I have to watch ADDS ADDS ADDS to unlock the house and there is only 15 minutes....I just want to play the hole house without adds and money😭😭😭😣😣😣 AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH always adds adds adds.CAN YOU REDUCE THE ADDS AND MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 waaaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaa😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 PLS DO SOMETHING!!!!!! I am not rich I am normal. Rich people can unlock the house with online money.","this game is really fun for my younger sister and i like it too my younger sister gives this game 5 stars but i give this game 4 stars because it only lets you play in the other rooms if you buyed the game or watch ads since i cant buy this game for personal reasons i have to watch ads all the time its like ads ads ads ads ads ads i am sick of it so unless you fix that my review will stay the same","I like the game but there is only two rooms and it's not good to like solve these things it is really hard but you can invite people over so that is good and you can't watch news but the only bad thing is there's only like you can't get through the other room so that is bad"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.pepiplay.pepihome","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pepiplay.pepihome&hl=en&gl=us"}]
