Don't waste your time with this laggy, horrible, glitchy app! Also with your other apps they're also glitchy and have way too much ads. Please fix this problem and I might consider 4 stars. The reason I didn't say 5 is because it gets really boring..","it is very good game but same problem in all the game of add and I am only saying that please degrees some adds whatever the game is very good it has many facilities like marble painting, spray, acrylic, stencil and many more I am only suggesting that degrees adds ,the game free download I am giving 1star you because of the adds","Really nice.If the adds annoy u,just turn off Wi-fi,and if u want 2 watch an add for a reward,turn it on,and keep it for a while,then simply turn it back on.That's all I can say.(BTW,love the new update!)","I absolutely love this game!

Don't need to spend if you know how to use the pop out ads to accumulate free grabs. Doesn't bore on scenery and accessories, but could use a more realistic prize display lineup, maybe a elimination mode and multiplayer mode. Also add some music and some interactive elements please! Great game regardless of the these minor flaws but I'll grab my claws now!!!!!!","This game is exciting and engaging for those who love claw games.In real claw machines,it is very difficult and rare to get a prize.However,the game developers make the game easier for players to collect prizes and even trade for more fun prizes.Lastly,thank you for making this game offline so that I can play it anytime!Keep up the good work!","A bit janky but it's a great time passer. A few issues, like too many coins built up I wish they had a rest on the prizes, also how am I supposed to do the task when the prize isn't there? Like you want me to collect two car prizes but there are no cars to collect? Over all I enjoy this game.","The games okay but you really can't play long enough to make much progress. I stopped playing for a long time because the screen was cluttered with so much on top of machine you where playing. Also 99.99% of the time the ad pop-ups for free energy, grabs, etc... never worked. I came back after almost a year to check it out and I see nothing has changed. It has the potential to be a very relaxing de-stressing game to if they would make some screen improvements and fix the ad pop-ups.","Will change to 5 ☆ if the problem gets fixed... This is an awesome game and brings back many memories playing game's like this at the Arcade. But there are a few glitches interfering with this game... The Joy stick gets stuck and moves on it's own and other screen glitches. My friend downloaded it also and she has the same problems with the app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gamecircus.PrizeClaw","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamecircus.PrizeClaw&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"WorldCraft: 3D Build & Block Craft","description":"★Welcome to WorldCraft - Best Crafting and Building 2020 Game Played by Thousands of Players ★\r\nPLAY NOW free creative online multiplayer games or survival exploration games.

Put signs anywhere in the world and write any text on them<br>- Nickname of the multiplayer map’s owner is displayed with green color<br>- Added screen safe area support for devices with notches and hole punches<br>- Improved survival maps saving<br>- Now you can feed tamed wolf and ocelot<br>- Now tamed wolves will follow player and attack hostile mobs<br>- Fixed issues with eating and digging when player moves quickly around","comments":["This game is really incredible and entertaining. But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Talking Pierre the Parrot","description":"Talking Pierre is in the house!

Sometimes it'll say \"Error Downloading Assets\" and sometimes (or mostly) when I hit Okay it'll start \"downloading\" again and keep coming up with the error message, often non-stop so I can't play the game and have to close it. The \"download\" even happens before and after battles in any mode.","It's a good game, but there are some serious issues. The game doesn't work for android since the last update. I continuously have to uninstall and reinstall the game to get it to work again. It works for a while and makes you download additional updates that won't download. Eventually it freezes up and I have to redo this again. Another issue is it cost pizza energy AND warp passes to skip? The warp pass should let you PASS or why even have those? Fix this or I'm done playing.","I love this game to death.but y'all haven't made any new stages in a long time.

We are talking grind to 30 while grinding mats for skills from story mode and grinding dna from hard mode to advance to three stars. Then you have to grind for higher quality of stars by farming pvp.

Pretty accurate and the UI is very clean & easy to read. Love the widgets as you can adjust the transparency. Weather forecasts for different locations within a town makes it even better than other weather apps. Great job, devs!","Trying to like this on Android, but why does the font get smaller for the temp that is displayed in the status bar when temp gets triple digits? It's small enough to begin with, even noted your sample screenshots here on Play Store have the status bar temp 'magnified'. Can you make it more readable?","I had originally gave a 4 star due to the fact of issues with radar,but I have changed my rating to a 5 because of quick response from developer and the willingness to take suggestions on how to make app better.

How the lowest possible amount to spend on bits with any mini game was only 100 bits. It's now 6000 bits! And that's the \"lowest amount possible\" to spend. The second is 12000 bits! About the same amount as it costs to expand to more land. Oh and the ads. They want you to watch 80 ads. 80!! Just for a reward that won't even matter because there's no way to back up and restore data. So, if you leave, be ready to start new.","I quite enjoyed this game several years ago, recently I've come back to play it and honestly, this is just a cash grab. Every event requires you to buy brand new characters, each character costs hundreds of gems. A lot of them even cost more than the maximum amount of gems that you can buy. This is insane and totally not worth it, play something else mares and gentelcolts.","I love it but few months back I downloaded it and it was kinda boring so I deleted. Then I downloaded today and played it, I didn't mind when it erased my progress (since it was a long time back). Then it started to kick me out. I had no option but to uninstall and install then it didn't tell me to go back to my old game and automatically started new game. I was so UPSET! Fix it please!!! :(","Would be better if there was a \"are you sure you want to purchase this?\" Option. I cannot tell you how many times I've saved up bits/gems, only for me to accidentally click on an item I didn't wanna buy (using gems to skip tasks, accidentally pressing the 40000 bits instead of the \"watch ad\" option for a minigame) I might actually stop playing cause I'm getting so upset over losing all the bits I've spent time saving up. But you're not reading so what does it matter? 😐","The game updated and deleted all my progress. I'm unable to contact support. I even spent money on this. I guess that's why you don't waste time with phone games. Also, they charge as much as $50+ on a single pony. The ponies don't do anything but add to your collection in most cases.

Including world, meltdown and the original (except you count online lvls, they'r awesome) - You should definitely try it, if you have an ginormous amount of time to kill, search for a little challenge and a lot of fun jumping up an down. I ONLY RECOMMEND THIS TO PPL WHO ARE ALREADY SINGLE. To prevent it. You should definitely stop here, if you have a slightly nervous tick already, let's not make that worse. Also seek help if.. you'll know.","When it comes to my experience with Geometry dash lite, I think I'm decent. The only levels I haven't beaten are clutterfunk, electroman adventures, and electrodynamix. Anyways, I never played subzero until now, and my thought on it is: I hate it. It's too hard. But that's the whole point of the game. You have done well in my book. 5/5 would recommend for people who want to feel as much pain and suffering as I did.","Love the levels! Few things though...how come you have 2.2 features in the levels but not in gd. The levels look so cool with the new features! HURRY up and finish the update already...pls. Also to anyone who is going to write a review on this game...you cant rate a game on its difficulty. Just get good.","I like this game alot, and when i play this, it is fun, but there are 3 levels. And they are pretty easy. And the \"coming soon\" has been there for like 8 months now. There is a secret level i think. It is hard, tricky, but cool. Keep up, And keep making these GD games, And i liked it bc of the name \"Geometry Dash SubZero\". Next game i'd like it to be called: \"Geometry Dash Hardcore\". And did you know, in \"PRESS START\" had DanTDM's old intro?","Awesome game! The problem is ads keep coming sometimes after I die so that's kind of irritating.. I would like new levels although I already like them which are currently in the game.. I wish this was for PC and Laptop too because I can't do power trip in mobile so thanks!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.robtopx.geometrydashsubzero","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robtopx.geometrydashsubzero&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Top Speed: Drag & Fast Racing","description":"Dominate your criminally insane rivals in extreme head-to-head drag races!\r\n\r\n• Pick from 69 cars: stock rides, dragsters, and police vehicles\r\n• Let your creativity flow through a ton of tuning and customization options\r\n• Drive in 5 city districts, each with its own unique theme and gang crew\r\n• A real-life inspired aircraft carrier to race on\r\n• Epic arcade game modes\r\n• Adrenaline inducing Most Wanted police chases\r\n• Mind-blowing 3D HD visuals\r\n\r\nReach impossible speeds by expertly timing gear changes and bursts of nitro\r\nTop Speed is setting the new standard within drag racing genre.

I love the design identity in resources. Of course, after daily playing this game for a year and a half, I feel the lack of the available resources to play with even after updating to a yearly major update this 2021. But that's okay – this is the only thing that bothers me and I'm waiting for a new update for this game. Awesome antistress, to be honest 😂👍","I love this little game so much! There is so much to do if you just wanna zone out and draw whatever. One tiny bug is that sometimes my brush size if i change it it goes really wonky. I fixed it by uninstalling and reinstalling but if this could be fixed in an update at some point? It isn't the biggest deal though really it's a great little game to just create (or destroy) things with and I highly recommend if you like just talking to yourself or listening to music as there's no ads","Never have I purchased anything this quick on the playstore (and only to add some not really needed options). No ads, only the 1 purchase option. Absolutely 5 stars. So much fun to see the particals falling, settling, floating etc, and of course exploding. Thanks for this wonderful gem of a game/simulator edit: still having fun with this from time to time! Edit2 still fun :)","Really good game, appreciate the absolute lack of ads. There is a few small bugs (if you set petrol/crude oil/nitroglycerin on fire, then explode with uranium, the fire turns into ash), but it works perfectly. Fun game, somehow managed to occupy me for quite awhile. Recommend download even just to try out. No complicated gravity physics, but it doesn't matter, it can run on my potato and that's good","i love it, obly complain i have, is that you removed plant block itvwas cool to play tmwith it, and i see kinda lack of usable resources, you cloud add gold, and some more. but after all its great. edit: you could add an eraser that removes only one type of block at time, so that you can remove, for example, the metal from which you make a mold that is hard not to break the tin figure you made, i apologize for my english"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"smellymoo.sand","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=smellymoo.sand&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"ASMR Slicing","description":"This is the most satisfying ASMR studio 3d for kinetic sand cutting.

In the add, the knife followed your finger as you swipe. So the speed at which it cut was directly controlled by the movement of your finger. In the actual game, you just press and hold, it moves at a constant speed. This frustrates me, not relaxes. Not to mention you cannot control the speed the object moves.

The only problem is (yep you guessed it) ADS. Seriously I cannot believe that all these mobile games are carried by microtransactions and ads. I get to level 2, AD I get the 100% for a new skin, I have to watch an AD, FOR SOMETHING I JUST EARNED. if you're looking for a good game, get this, but be prepared to be watching movies while playing.","Great but my stuff is gone. At some point the game updated and all my guns, skins, outfits, puzzle peices, and the hideout unlock ables are just gone. My purchase stuff is all gone except the no ads. I had entirely too many hours invested to start over. I'll give the developer time to make it right or I'm just going to delete. Great game once you get rid of the ads. Would easily rate this a 5 star but this little hiccup has turned me off.","This is amazing. Plus, the amount of ads actually isn't that much. I'm used to ads being after every level. In this, each ad is every 5 levels. A FREE mobile game is going to have ADS people. Get used to it.","Class game and I love the graphics put into the gun animation.dont like ads? Not a problem. Just turn off your WiFi and no ads!but then you don't get ad-watching prizes. Or put on the TV. Just watch the TV when the ads come on. Awesome game.keep it up.","Fun game but at level325 it requires explosions that overwhelm my processor and throws me out of the game. I'll be uninstalling if this is not fixed... so I did that and now I have a better phone so I'm trying it again. It is still very fun."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.time.trigger","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.time.trigger&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Paper.io 2","description":"You liked Paper.io ?

Please fix them. It's frustrating to get a decent chunk and the whole entire thing dissappears and you're left with a line. Or dying after watching an ad for the extra life before you even get to touch the screen. You shouldn't be able to die on your own area. I wish I could choose the plain black square, as the other colors are easily confused as I am color- blind. A year later & I almost had the whole thing and my land disappeared. Very disappointed. -1 star","Eat too many ads to the point where i can't even click out of it and it glitches out sometimes. Every 3 kills an ad, before and after to play an ad.This game is so easy but playing on a computer is better. Once I watched a video to play again and then another player killed me right when I went back in and the game completely glithed out. I would be nice and rate this 2 stars but nvm. Uninstallimg immediately.","This game is amazing. I love this game. The ads are not too much. Many games has ads in middle but this game doesn't have. So i am rating this app 5 out of 5 . No complaint . I am playing this game almost for 1 month after that I am giving my review. Normally i download one game and that game I delete in maximum 7 days. But I didn't deleted this game as it's not making me feel bore. Try it once you will enjoy it so much.","This game is pretty good, but there's only one Problem. The thing is there's too many adds, the fact that it gives you random choices to pick after the add is done. I like that though the adds are just too much, if you can fix it please do it, it will only help more people through the game, anyways I like this game and I want it to be the best made game. Thanks for reading this.","It has good gameplay, but there are 𝘸𝘢𝘺 too many ads. I've 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 played a game with this many ads, there's ads like every 10 seconds while you're in the middle of a game. The game doesn't require internet and you're actually playing with bots, but they force you to keep it on so you can't get out of watching the ads. I don't recommend this game to anyone."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.voodoo.paper2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.voodoo.paper2&hl=en&gl=us"}]
