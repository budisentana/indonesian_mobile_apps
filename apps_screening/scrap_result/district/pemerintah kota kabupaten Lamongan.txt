There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

The update is quite complex. You can't log back into the game if you dont sign in if by any chance you have to reinstall the app. The chat is way different than it was and it basically is like they have completely took the chat away from us. Recently I have experienced that I can't get onto any servers even if I host a server myself. There is only one way I can get on. FIX THIS!!!!!!","I used to love love love this game. The new chat has ruined it.... And it's too bad! I also get disconnected from the server EVERY game. I haven't been able to finish a game in I don't know how long because I get disconnected. So annoying :( Talking about the chat it is just terrible... It takes too much time to navigate though the option and it isn't intuitive at all. An essential part of among us was the chat! Bring it back!!!!","I really love this game. The two stars are because: there are added colors and more players. The others was because of that update. Yes, I know that everyone is talking about it. The chat update. It's really terrible. You can't say what you want. Why don't you just cover some letters on the bad words, though? And because of that, I took away my three stars. Please remove the terrible updates that we hate. If you do, we will bring back some stars. But, please don't add more/keep terrible updates.","It used to be a really fun game to play with your friends. A classic murder mystery with a unique art style. However the creators ruined the game by adding in the auto chat. Now no one will take what you say seriously because it is now impossible to explain yourself. I feel like removing auto chat or making it optional would fix all the problems that the creators have now made for themselves. It's disappointing that I can't play it with my friends because the developers ruined it completely.","I used to love this game since 2018. The new game update (Quick Chat) is now permanent and there is nothing more annoying than that. The social element is gone as the new chat functions are just so robotic. We can't debate and investigate the real imposter, which used to the real thrill and fun from this game. The update just removed the very essence that makes this game so enjoyable in the past.

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Hide 'N Seek!","description":"The good old classic hide & seek.

But the only one thing is that too manyy ads .. But a good game i would never delete it no mater what pepole out there they have to donloud this its the best game i ever had ... Stay safe .. Pepole out there that thinks this sucks there hateing on you and never belive it .. Couse every body trys there best ...love you guys out there ..","Was fun for the first 5 minutes; but that's as much credit as I can give the game. The huge issue with this game is the barrage of ads that play, you get ads after every single game, you get ads DURING gameplay, you get ads when you win, get caught, etc. Ads that play during the game also lag your phone. Not to mention the multiplayer is fake and you only play AI despite the game pretending to be you vs others. You need internet connection solely so the game can run ads, not for playing online."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.seenax.HideAndSeek","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seenax.HideAndSeek&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Waplog - Dating App to Chat & Meet New People","description":"Waplog Dating App\r\n\r\nThe fastest-growing dating app with more than 90 million users worldwide.

What a waste of time it was you need different speed ups for different things like troops for example there is no generic speed up for all troop types but multiple types of speed ups you can only use for certain class plus for me to progress from where I left I have to spend a tonne of money I cant upgrade or do research unless I buy packs this is not a free to play game. It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!!

It is much more than your average city simulator or one of the tycoon games. It takes the best of two worlds in just the right proportions: the sense of adventure from airplane games, and the need to plan strategically from the city simulators.

See how many souvenirs can fit in one aircraft!<br>But it’s not just a flight simulator—you’ll have to apply your outstanding management skills to develop all the supporting infrastructure too, in one of the most amazing airport games! Take care of the entire city next to it, to provide your airport all the required services.<br><br>If what you’re looking for in city building games is peaceful gameplay and interactions, this city simulator is exactly what you need.

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Survivalcraft Demo","description":"You are marooned on the shores of an infinite blocky world.

I decided there should be a sandbox mode in the game and that you build and create your own map and use your own imagination to set your map up and you can save the map and name what even you like.

You just collect coins all the time...the first beach buggy is fun and way more better I just wish more stages can be added to the first beach buggy....I've reset the first beach buggy like 5times now it's much more fun than beach buggy blits and beach buggy 2...infact I'm uninstalling right away.","Lovely game, but why are they not giving a competition, I don't like it when I race alone, I see other drivers who are just roaming around, I even prefer beach buggy 1 than this, and they are no levels to unlock, the time trial is good but it would be better if it was in another stage","This game looks great and runs smooth. I also like it because it does not force you to purchase anything to advance in the game or shove ads in your face. Great game, highly recommended.","Very fun the maps are very interesting and I highly recommend this game to people if they like of road stuff over all it is a great game👍","Its fun and all but i was expecting something like an adventure,Like You still get to race Just like beach buggy after you Beat All Of the Boss."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.vectorunit.yellow","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vectorunit.yellow&hl=en&gl=us"}]
