Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Forge of Empires: Build your City","description":"Forge of Empires - Build a city!\r\n\r\nBuild an empire & travel through the ages!

Get it.","It's a very fun game, very addictive, but for some reason it isn't letting me log in. It keeps saying to check my connection it I have internet. It doesn't work on wifi or mobile data. I've checked both connections with other apps that require internet and they work just fine so I'm not really sure what's going on..","I tried playing the game again and it is much better. It is a lot easier to research and the new things I have unlocked are very exciting.(I am in early middle ages). Although I do have some suggestions. I think goods should be less involved in researching and more in simply trading for coins, materials, and even diamonds. Also think armies should be a little bigger for both player and enemy just to be realistic. Armies should also become bigger through the ages. I have updated my rating to 4","I can see now how this game has lasted 6 years with consistent updates. I got to play a total of 11 mins and 30 secs before i was exiting out because there's nothing i can do but wait hours for resources to accumulate enough to finish the next task.

I would like to see when it asks for my age to also have the option to just sign-in to google play games where my entire city is backed up on. Its extreamly frustrating and after all these years I highly doubt I am the only one.","It's a great game, playing for a few years, will keep playing. Would like to see more design element control. Turn off building upgrades, even force no upgrades. While you can play, it's rather 'pay'. My children can't get far in this game. They need $$$. I don't mind paying, yet this game is a cash cow ! Very greedy game. Visit another city you may get $5, that's like worth 10 cents. Not a great reward. War rewards are terrible. Global trade hq, always hiding what you need. EA reward time !","Had a good time with this for a day, until I hit level that unlocks schools and transportation. Then I realized it would take forever to get the money for those buildings, and that's when the game so conveniently showed me some rather expensive options to get them immediately. Of course it did... Typical EA. Uninstalled.","Halfway decent game Graphics are cool, but unfortunately just like every other game out there on any tablet or computer or phone you got to pay to play prices are too high for some stuff but they do that so if you have to buy to be able to build City you want. I'm not on very often to play just because of that, maybe they should rethink your s*** because the prices are way too high and it's not like he has any overhead cost in production of this stuff","The game is good, the graphics, ambience, and the day and night cycle is just so amazing! But one thing I've noticed is that as you progress and as you build more buildings, it gets harder to renovate and to edit your city and it takes so much time to move all your buildings by holding it one by one and moving it all to the corner just to insert an another building. It'd be better if you'll add a city layout edit where you can store all your buildings & roads at once and place them freely.üòÖ"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.ea.game.simcitymobile_row","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.game.simcitymobile_row&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"NewsBreak: Local News that Connects the Community","description":"News Break believes that local news is different.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much!

What a waste of time it was you need different speed ups for different things like troops for example there is no generic speed up for all troop types but multiple types of speed ups you can only use for certain class plus for me to progress from where I left I have to spend a tonne of money I cant upgrade or do research unless I buy packs this is not a free to play game. It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!!

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

However, i have given it 4 stars because of a glitch that i do not know how to fix. I have made two custom characters, but I can only get one to appear at a time. one will appear, but when i edit the other one so it appears as well the first one vanishes, and can't be found under the stop sign menu. in addition, there are a lot, and i mean a lot of in app purchases, and there is almost nothing for free to play users.","Toca world is an Amazing game! It is full of imagination and creativity. It is a good game for children about the age 6-11. I have played Toca games for about 5 years now and I'm still not bored of it. For a start, when I first played Toca games I loved them! And so when Toca World came out I wanted to play it so bad because all the games were mixed together. For the positives, It doesn't have many ads at all. For the Negatives, you have to pay to expand your world which isn't much of a problem.","I love this app! And the new stuff! But this review Is not mine but is gonna be for my friend. She made a schoolhouse last night or something, Next day (which is today) everything disappeared... Some stuff are not available to get anymore :(. Like she lost the backpack from the gift which is not available anymore (I think?) I really wanna help her out but I dont know how. Soooooo the only way to fix this was telling it in a review! I dont know how you can help but... This was worth it ^_^","There are few complaints I need to make sure get patched. 1, I make 2 characters in the creator. As soon as I go to the floogle place, it only gives me only one character. 2. I put things on the walls, few seconds later it disappears also with other things it happens. Also, it won't let me open boxes. It's annoying because it's with my friend aswell.","I love this app and others do love it to but the only problem is, (why its only 4 stars) is it takes so long to load in the game for me, I have a samsung galaxy if that helps please make it load faster if you can and maybe add more houses? I think everyone would go bonkers if you added new houses and items and new hair styles and clothes, so sorry for only 4 stars but the loading could be better, but I look foreward to playing this game

listen to the most. With a new set of songs each Wednesday, there is always more to explore. ","comments":["This is the first (and only) music app I have ever used. And my GOD what a choice of songs. YouTube Music must have every song üéµ in the world!! And eventually if you hit the like button often enough they will create a list of just your favorite songs/videos. I pay for YouTube premium and I'm sure that's why I don't get any ads at all. I'm very üòä happy with YouTube Music so far.","This app is alright. I have premium, so I can't comment of the ads. The functions for listening to songs are quite good. However, ocationaly on songs it will say they are from a different artist, or play a song to what it says and what the album cover is. For example, when I went into thefatrat's \"Rise up\" it played a song called solitude instead. This was later fixed, however, if I go to the song, \"Kings and Queens Part two\" by Ava Max, it will sometimes play the wrong song.","The radio option is the only thing I really don't like about it. When you selected \"radio\" on an artist in Google play music it played songs that were from similar artists. YTM however, seems to play songs from artists that you've listened to a lot. Example: Hit the radio button on a power metal artist and the radio starts playing a bunch of TOOL because I've listened to them a lot and it really doesn't fit at all, especially when I'm using it to explore other artists in the power metal genre.","Not fit for purpose. I've been trying to work with this junk since launch. Spent months creating 12 playlists across 12 genres, totalling 9,170 tracks to listen to my playlists across my 7 Google hub max speakers. However, regardless of what playlist you select, even on shuffle, it will always start off playing the first track. It will then continue to play the same 20 or 30 tracks over and over again all day long even when playlist has over 1000 tracks. Switched to Spotify yesterday, heaven!!","I enjoy using the app. It creates several Mixes for you from different genres & eras that you listen to so you can choose what you're in the mood for. Every Wednesday there's a Discover Mix which I love. It's a mix of music they think you'll like based on your music choices. I'd give it 5 stars, but they took away the tab that used to drop down with your task bar. That was great bc you could skip through songs without leaving the app you're currently in.

If everyone is having the same issue connecting to Chromecast, it's your problem not ours. If this doesn't get resolved during my 30 day premium trial, I'll definitely return to Spotify... I suggest everyone reading this comment to do the same! Yes I checked the Pandora community and they all have the same issue. Unfortunately back to Spotify...","Please add ability to reorder stations not only by recent and a-z. I have discovered so many new songs that I love. I miss the comment feature it allowed me to follow people with similar tastes and discover more awesome songs. Please bring that feature back. Also miss the feature that allowed me to scroll thru all the music I played now have to go one by one. Also please bring back 30 sec sample of song. It allowed to listen to songs by same artist if i liked them. Thanks keep up the good work.","I used to love Pandora and pay for offline listening. I've deleted half my stations just to get variety on offline thumbprint radio but once I go offline, I only have the same 3 songs playing. And the variety sucks. Only popular songs by an artist ever come up. Listen. I like full albums. The same 4 Foo Fighters songs is pretty old. It isn't worth it anymore. Nothing new ever comes up.

Put like a 5 minute grace period in or something reasonable.","Enjoy this application for many years now. However, recently I am having issues with the sleep timer on my favorite radio station. Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","It's a good app, you can access 1000s of stations but one of the joys that made it similar to listening to a real live radio was the sleep timer feature. It's not working on the current version for some reason which is a shame and a pain. Not an issue if listening during the day, I would imagine though.","App often goes into endless cycle of ads and doesn't return to radio station I'm listening to. I understand having ads when I'm not paying for subscription but I just listened to 20 minutes of ads and had to turn off because it won't return to radio station I was listening to. Have to close, reopen, listen to more ads then back to station. And then when radio station returns from its own commercial break TuneIn will suddenly cut to its own ads & begins endless cycle of ads w/o return to station."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"tunein.player","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"DJ Studio 5 - Free music mixer","description":"DJStudio is a free, robust and powerful party-proof virtual turntable for DJs which enables you to mix, remix, scratch, loop or pitch your music in the palm of your hands.\r\nDesigned to be user friendly, social and responsive, you now have the keys to mix your music and rule the party.\r\n\r\n‚òÜ More than 50 millions downloads - thank you so much ‚òÜ \r\n\r\nDJ Studio respects you:\r\n‚òÖ Full app for FREE, no hidden cost.\r\n‚òÖ No registration fee.\r\n‚òÖ No limitation, no watermark.\r\n‚òÖ No trackers.\r\n‚òÖ No stealing data.\r\n‚òÖ No popups everywhere, everyday. \r\n‚òÖ No premium, platinum only features, everything is included.\r\n‚òÖ Freely removable ads.\r\n‚òÖ Only optional paid skins to support our work.\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n‚òÖ Wide compatibility : Android 2.3 and more\r\n‚òÖ 2 virtual turntables with cross fader\r\n‚òÖ Customise your decks with up to 7 skins!\r\n‚òÖ Unique scratch engine and disc physics\r\n‚òÖ Access and browse your mp3 music library by folder, artist, album, name\r\n‚òÖ Edit and re-order playlist\r\n‚òÖ 8 sound effects: Flanger, Phaser, Gate, Reverb, Bit crusher, 3D, Brake and FlippingDouble\r\n‚òÖ 3-bands equaliser for each deck\r\n‚òÖ 10 customisable sample pads\r\n‚òÖ One CUE/RECALL point per deck\r\n‚òÖ IN/OUT and beat based loops\r\n‚òÖ Pre-Cueing with headphones or Y-cable\r\n‚òÖ Automatic landscape and portrait mode\r\n‚òÖ Live record your mixes with the built-in recorder\r\n‚òÖ Auto-mix feature (random & playlist modes)\r\n‚òÖ Share your mixes on the SoundCloud social network\r\n‚òÖ Live sound spectrum view with beats detection and zoom\r\n‚òÖ Use your wave and mp3 music library\r\n‚òÖ Designed for Nexus devices\r\n‚òÖ Share with friends on social networks with Facebook, Tweeter or Google+\r\n‚òÖ Compatible with iRigMIX‚Ñ¢ from IK Multimedia*\r\n\r\nSystem requirements:\r\n‚òÖ Screen compatibility from 3.7\" to 10\" and HD screens\r\n‚òÖ Wide OS compatibility : since OS 2.3\r\n‚òÖ Min 1 core 800Mhz, recommended 2 cores\r\n‚òÖ 2 cores required for scratch option\r\n‚òÖ 1 GB RAM recommended\r\n‚òÖ Multi-touch since 3.0\r\n\r\nDJStudio is an advanced DJ application suitable for everybody whether you are a novice or a pro.

I upgraded and paid for the version without the ads. Once I did that, the Bluetooth on my Galaxy S6 stopped working. it would not work in my vehicle, it would not work on my headset, and it would not work on my cell phone enabled landline. My wife has the same phone and the free version and her Bluetooth works fine with all of her devices. in troubleshooting I uninstalled the app, and the Bluetooth went back to working as it should. Not happy. Waste of money!","GREAT APP! THANKS!! I am glad I didn't check reviews before my purchase! I usually do but I just read you have to call a service to get a call added to a group to record, not true for me! I also read Bluetooth doesn't connect after paying for subscription, WORKS FINE 4 ME, seen call only recorded 2 mins out an hr. Maybe their settings arent set right? Mine records all the way & see a few complaints about prices, $11.98 for a yr is the same as $1 a month! Any cheaper it'd be free","Paid for lifetime pro version several years ago. Was working great, after an update several months ago, the price for pro is outrageous, I keep getting pop-ups to purchase even though I already have! I've contacted the developer many times about my previous purchase; even sent them my original receipt and never have gotten a response nor had my lifetime purchase honored!","Signed up the expensive paid service and only 2 minutes of an hour long call was recorded! It was an important interview that I now have to reschedule because this stupid app simply didn't do its job, despite how much it charges. Embarrassing. Recordings are also muffled sounding at best and simply not good enough for the price. Also awkward to use. Have to call a dialing service and add your caller to a group call with the recording service basically.","I have had this same app on another phone just like it several years now. It works great there, but on several other phones that I just installed it on it won't record anything. And now you say if it won't work upgrade from free to make it work? Just how dumb do you think people are? You have converted this app from a free app to a bait and switch app, to manipulate people into buying it!!! So dishonest!!!! Also to have to call a service number to record is stupid!! I deleted this quickly!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"call.recorder.automatic.acr","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=call.recorder.automatic.acr&hl=en&gl=us"}]
