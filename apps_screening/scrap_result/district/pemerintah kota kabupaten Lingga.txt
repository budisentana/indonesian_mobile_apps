Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen.

Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2.

It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more ..

So like I said this app is okay.","The notification wont go away if you try to swip it away, and it wont let me Force stop the app it will keep popping up the notification, and it wont let me delete it it will just make me keep the app and say i have to update it don't get this app it dosen't even work","Really works Well... The only negatives for me is I wish it didn't have the advertisements popping up but being this was a free app I guess you have to take the bad with the good or (is that the good with the bad lol). With other free apps I've used the apps were slammed full of pop up ADs. So comparing this app with those, this app has a lot less ADs. The company has to make money somehow. So to continue to get the app for free I will just have to deal with it. Plus I would rather the ADs pay for it rather then me.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. üòê","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Baca - Baca Berita Terkini & Video Humor","description":"BACA merupakan konten aggregator yang mengumpulkan konten dari beragam sumber berita terpercaya dan menyajikannya kepada kamu setiap saat.

The only downside is it is quite quirky and I lost two purchases that amounted to over $40 because I was changing screens too quickly they say. I have no proof so I'm out my money but the game is awesome just needs work on how it runs.","I think the game is great. Its fun and keeps me fairly preoccupied. The biggest issue I have with this game is the customer service. I spend more than my fair share purchasing game packs. The one time I had an issue with mafia city's system updates, I reached out and all I hear were excuses as to why theh are unable to give me back the gold I purchased (by the way).","Just another city builder/resource management sim, but with a \"mafia\" theme. Nothing like the ads you've seen. Pushy with microtransactions but definitely not the worst I've experienced. The audio quality is awful and the art style is nothing special. My #1 gripe is when games like this block you from the 2nd building slot with no way to unlock other than spending real money, such is the case here. If you're actually into this style of game you can find much better elsewhere.","So far so good. Have not experienced any serious issues.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn‚Äôt start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PlayKids - Cartoons, Books and Educational Games","description":"Children learn to read, watch videos, and read ebooks.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth! Had huge glitch on my game play, took a couple of weeks to fix, they got it done!!! Thank you all. Awesome job well done. Totally locked in forever. üëçüëç Once again the Tech Team has stepped up to Excellence. Thanks üòä 7.21.21","Fantastic idea ! 2 stars missing because this game does not load properly. Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building.
