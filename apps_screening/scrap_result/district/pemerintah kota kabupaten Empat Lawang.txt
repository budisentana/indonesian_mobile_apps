So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going. They need to fix that but is something I could live with it. Using Google pixel 5","I've read through your support forums. Can't find answers. Issue started Aug 2nd. All features work except sms.

It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bus Rush","description":"Bus Rush is an amazing running game for Android.

You can learn to pet games like Pou, or all of the virtual games.... It's ok if my review is not helpful... The important thing is.. You can't pet Moy, you can't pet any virtual games... I know what you're thinking \"Any virtual games are not educational...\" But that's what you only think","Nice game, especially when it's only the 4th version! Although i get bombarded with ads of the new game, you can try it! But it'll take more space. The evolution game is especially fun when you're an evolution games pro player.","Moy 4 is a really nice game and I love playing the mini games. But I am on level thirty three right now and every time I leave the game when I go back I realise that I have been taken back in the level.

Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

But I just downloaded this game again and I have access to it now xD. So um I give it 4 stars","I decided to download the game again after a few years and it's still a great time killer. Plus the in app purchases aren't unreasonable like other games in my opinion. You can get everything in the game + no ads for only 5 bucks which is pretty good.","I have a suggestion. since I have bought all the maps and cars, I have been playing for a long time. I decided there should be a sandbox mode in the game and that you build and create your own map and use your own imagination to set your map up and you can save the map and name what even you like.

I get chests everyday , I have 1000 diamonds and I also like my daily levels , the reason I love this game is because I get to have featured levels , quests and all for free! That 150 130 gem thing must be a bug. I have also completed half of the featured levels and 5 daily levels. And 82 things like icons , ships ,balls , ufos , waves , robots, spiders , trails , death effects and colors. This one is a little bit better than geometry dash (but not full version) so,yeah!","This game is amazing, theres alot of things to do and its very fun. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because everytime I get diamonds from quests something weird happens. Everytime I leave and come back for some reason I start to loose my diamonds. I used to have 150 diamonds but now I have 130. It's very wierd and annoying but although of that this games is good!","It has amazing music and the obstacles are abstract and colourful, the beat matches every obstacle as well. It's an amazing game, and I recommend it to those who have fast fingers and like electronic music. I have no complaints about this game, so it earns a five-star rating from me. If at First You Don't Succeed, try, try again.","I completed gd world in just 1 attempt, super fun and colorful, different varieties of icons, colors, online+daily lvls, perfect sync, lots of things to collect and most definitely great soundtracks! (in my case I don't get many ads) but there are only 10 lvls and freaking short. Want rob to add more lvls. Anyways, Def 5 stars and suggested to download this app!","I love this app so much.I just dont understand why it just stops working sometimes?When ads come i always click on them and then i go to google play and get back to the game,but sometimes it yeets me to my browser???I dont get why that happens but im on redmi note 8T and i hope thatll be fixed soon.When i enter the app sometimes,Its just a black screen with lighter fazes if grey,and it doesnt work until i reset my phone.Please fix these bugs!!😔💓"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.robtopx.geometrydashworld","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robtopx.geometrydashworld&hl=en&gl=us"}]
