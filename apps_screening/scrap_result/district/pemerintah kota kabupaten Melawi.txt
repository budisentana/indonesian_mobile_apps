So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static. Still, it's great for people who use wired headphones. I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","The app work fine but when you quit an app it's notification keeps persistent for a couple of seconds. The app doesn't look very modern, it looks like it's from 2010. The app keep removing the names of radio stations I saved. So please fix it. Moreover this app doesn't support Android 11 media controls.","This app came preinstalled with my phone and is one of the few that I haven't tried to remove. It doesn't require an internet connection and so is the perfect go to entertainment when I have no mobile data. The sound quality is as good as any radio, with the convenience of having it on your mobile device. There are no in app purchases to unlock stations or premium features. It's the only radio I need.","Everything just works. Simple layout, doesn't need an internet connection and has useful features like recording.

I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other.

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"WorldCraft: 3D Build & Block Craft","description":"★Welcome to WorldCraft - Best Crafting and Building 2020 Game Played by Thousands of Players ★\r\nPLAY NOW free creative online multiplayer games or survival exploration games.

In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game.","I love this game so much! My sister always play this everyday. Also I was wondering if you can add more characters that look like cartoons or movies games like FNaF and your style.thank you!","The game is useless you can't even get out the respawn area at all u can't even move hardly update ur game so pepole can actually play without any issues remove the ads the game is horrible you can't even get out the respawn area at all u don't even have half the stuff needed for the game it should not be on play store no flints for the tnt and no pickaxe nothing its terrible I do not recommend downloading the game because its useless","So far it's a pretty good game, runs smoothly in multiplayer for me. I have actual minecraft so I usually only play this with a friend who doesn't. Creative mode is pretty good so far but hasn't been updated in ages. Could you add more blocks? For example, stairs, rods, signs, animal spawn eggs, and more. Oh, the ability to place trap doors lower would be a nice addition. Also could it be possible for pressure plates, sticky pistons, honey blocks, and redstone to be added in, in the future?"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Waplog - Dating App to Chat & Meet New People","description":"Waplog Dating App\r\n\r\nThe fastest-growing dating app with more than 90 million users worldwide.

I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate.

I get chests everyday , I have 1000 diamonds and I also like my daily levels , the reason I love this game is because I get to have featured levels , quests and all for free! That 150 130 gem thing must be a bug. I have also completed half of the featured levels and 5 daily levels. And 82 things like icons , ships ,balls , ufos , waves , robots, spiders , trails , death effects and colors. This one is a little bit better than geometry dash (but not full version) so,yeah!","This game is amazing, theres alot of things to do and its very fun. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because everytime I get diamonds from quests something weird happens. Everytime I leave and come back for some reason I start to loose my diamonds. I used to have 150 diamonds but now I have 130. It's very wierd and annoying but although of that this games is good!","It has amazing music and the obstacles are abstract and colourful, the beat matches every obstacle as well. It's an amazing game, and I recommend it to those who have fast fingers and like electronic music. I have no complaints about this game, so it earns a five-star rating from me. If at First You Don't Succeed, try, try again.","I completed gd world in just 1 attempt, super fun and colorful, different varieties of icons, colors, online+daily lvls, perfect sync, lots of things to collect and most definitely great soundtracks! (in my case I don't get many ads) but there are only 10 lvls and freaking short. Want rob to add more lvls. Anyways, Def 5 stars and suggested to download this app!","I love this app so much.I just dont understand why it just stops working sometimes?When ads come i always click on them and then i go to google play and get back to the game,but sometimes it yeets me to my browser???I dont get why that happens but im on redmi note 8T and i hope thatll be fixed soon.When i enter the app sometimes,Its just a black screen with lighter fazes if grey,and it doesnt work until i reset my phone.Please fix these bugs!!😔💓"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.robtopx.geometrydashworld","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robtopx.geometrydashworld&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"NewsBreak: Local News that Connects the Community","description":"News Break believes that local news is different.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much!

I go to update it and it's already updated. But underneath it says something about my NFL Redzone I purchased last year near the \"Subscription\" button. But when I click the Subscription button it doesn't show anything. I do not know how to get into the app anymore.. I've deleted and re-download but nothing is working. Please help!!!","Really great app has everything you need for your football team the only downside I see to this app is during the live games you can watch it starts lagging really bad. Not all the games but a good majority of them but if you like me and you don't have cable it's the best way to be able to watch the game","I've always enjoyed the app but today when I attempted to open it, I got a message saying, \"Please update to the latest version of the app before continuing\". Then it shows a button that says, \"Go to update\". When I click on that, it sends me back to the app store but it does not update the app. I've tried to delete it and reinstall it several times and I still get the same results. Is this something that is going to be fixed?","Thank you for this App. Appreciate it so much. Because when you don't have t.v and only a phone and this is only what you have it is definitely appreciated. I don't mind the glitches and spin wheels and cut outs. I still have football. Again Thank You...","It does not work half the time has little glitch that bug you like the sound not working or if you are on wife it won't load videos. Are articles.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive.

Force stop creates additional trouble ... It always pops up again. It is mandatory extortion. I have 3 Alcatel pieces, 2 tablets and a phone. All are creating problems. I am installing new Android and will never ever vouch for Alcatel again. I had been one of the biggest Alcatel fan, but this has killed it all. Pl stop cleaner","Starting to get ad spam. Annoying as heck. Phone goes off each time I use it to clean ad junk. Sick of the spam. Can't uninstall or force stop on this stupid app. Keeps resetting to restart. I sent screenshot and email.

But I had to do this. First, why are you trying so hard to force me to use your cleaner app? This app for fike managing, get your game together, I don't want it. I should be able to at least decide not to use the functionality. Second, stop putting ads on the app everywhere.

It's supposed to be that way. This game has a lot to offer. I can't do the minigames like make the worm go through a hoop, like 18 hoops in 2 minutes. I am lucky to get 8 of them in 2 minutes. Or bump the crates to make them hit the enemies. I am lucky if i can even bump the crates. I would like it if it had more sounds.","SUPER COOL,but as much as i hate to say it,theres a problem!It need energy to play missions and stuf and when run out energy and ads.you can play!so it makes it worse please cancel energy bc i ruin all th fun.👒😔😃","Constant Push for Microtransactions. Makes me feel like I'm also an enraged worm but I'll uninstall to avoid the stress. Seriously guys. This is bs","UPDATE; July 29th, 2021~What happened to the Epic Growl? Now you have the big jump Or whatever its called which doesnt work at all. Please put back EPIC GROWL , IT WAS BEST EFFECT EVER and please make fireballs free so game is more enjoyable instead of having to watch ads constantly and only play game in between ads. Also i notice right after you give me 6 fireballs the game ends and this happens alot, so why dont my fireballs come with me to next round? That would be fair since i have either","Really fun games! I even can play it offline and the app size is small. But for me the worm's movement control a bit \"wild\" and too fast.
