Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years

Loud ads KILL this app!!!! It is so annoying to have the alarm go off and then have to wait 5 or 10 seconds through an annoying ad before I can shut that off. It especially sucks if you have someone else in the bed with you who gets up later. Yeah, the wife gets pissed off because it wakes her up completely. \"Sorry honey, just waot for the annoying ad with the jackhammer sound then go back to sleep.\" Yeah right. Silent ads are ok","Last couple of nights my alarm hasn't gone off, I've never had this problem and I've had the app for about 3 years. At first I thought I turned my alarm off but when I went into the app the app said my alarms were still on so I don't really know what the problem is. Maybe it is my fault when the problem is solved ill definitely give 5 stars, and I love the app alot better than the default alarm app","One big flaw with this app is that for whatever reason if YouTube is open, the alarm you have set will get turned off at some point. I like to sleep to audio; like rain or a video and this has caused me to be, in some real world cases; late (including today as I am writing this review!). If not for this weakness that literally defeats the point of having this app, I would rate higher because overall for it's ease of access and use.","Customer service was fast and good to work with. Still a great program. Thanks for all the help. Dean Love the program. I purchased it a while back and all was good until just recently. It now has ads. The problem is I have 3 Google accounts for different emails and it is looking at 1 that I didn't use to purchase it with. If I delete the account it shows paid. If I add it back it has ads. It didn't use to do this. Any help would be great.","very flexible alarm. Different alarms, many different ways to be woken.This is the only alarm that actually works well with Google. I use the solve the math expression way they provide.. I just wish the display wasn't so dark- its very slow to brighten up by sliding fingers up and down.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

Obviously need to read the manual and then re-review.","The app can take 2 or three tries to fully function in Android Auto. That's a problem. Also it does not matter what channel or volume you set in the app the voice engine will cut out source audio. You can have the voice or you can have silence but you can't navigate to a point and listen to anything without interruption. Unless there is a solution the developer will not share this app is not ready for Primetime.","Closing the app in system task manager caused that all my saved routes GONE! Same thing with blocked roads edited by myself. All gone. Need to fix this or set a reminder for users that they always have to close the app proper using 'Exit', not just killing it in task manager. BTW. 'average speed' panel doesn't work.","Maps not bad (OSM); interface/search atrocious. Example: asks for country; type United it prompts with Kingdom, back up, type States - frowny face. Must type name of state, which isn't a country. When you get a possibility there is no \"show on map\" except in various unfathomable contexts. Getting beyond Last Search takes gymnastics and a few MAJOR shopping centers in my area not in database. So, free, navigation OK, UI big flunk. Needs real user input + UI/workflow redesign.

I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going. They need to fix that but is something I could live with it. Using Google pixel 5","I've read through your support forums. Can't find answers. Issue started Aug 2nd. All features work except sms.

It's really a great game. Rephrase that. If money wasn't the top priority this app would be so awesome for all consumers to enjoy. If u don't have 100 bucks a week to spend at the least. Don't play ffxv.","You can play free to play but its made so that some items are only available for a limited time or never and if you miss them you have to wait until they are offered as a prize months later. The p2p players can gift others a catch up token which often includes things past the paywall which is nice. Its a war game much much more than a city building one. Tries to get you to spend $. And different pack offers based on spending tier.","This game is legitimate garbage. All it does is drag the final fantasy name through the mud. You try and play and just get one tapped by someone 2 levels above you since they love balancing to make players spend money. If you don't spend or know people who will help you by spending than you're not gonna go anywhere. The support, sorry \"support\" actually told me when I have issues its my fault. I asked about the scaling of their events. They said its only for high levels spend money. GG Greed","I give it 5 stars cause it has helped me thru very tough times. Being able to talk communicate and strategize with other players. Never experienced anything like it. I was able to stay out of trouble and to better my life at same time. We all experience difficulties on buying packs. But truthfully I'm seeing people that has not spent money are hardly any catch up to the rest of us that do spend regularly.This is why buying the empire boosts are a must.This is what makes you better. GOD bless","0/10 Would not recommend. Pros: If you don't value your time and money, Congratulations you are the target audience for this game. Cons: 1) A window pops-up every 10 seconds telling you to spend money and you can't tell it to go away for the day like some other games with a similar pop-up. 2) The game doesn't really have anything to do with FF. They just took a poorly made game and through-in some pngs of ffXV characters.

Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great.

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much! Saying that the local news I receive is great and helps keep me up-to-date!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.particlenews.newsbreak","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.particlenews.newsbreak&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Earth","description":"Explore the whole world from above with satellite imagery and 3D terrain of the entire globe and 3D buildings in hundreds of cities around the world.

This app is amazing... but the issue is. On my galaxy A11, the app works smoothly when I open the app, then after a few minutes staying on the app it starts to lag. When it gets really bad it either locks up my phone, black screen, and or the app closing out by itself... I want to enjoy the full experience of the app because I love to explore. Thank you.","Typing in the search box was impossible. Letters were erasing themselves as I was typing. I updated my Gboard. The same thing happened. Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.)

And I've always hated default alarms, so the connection to Spotify was kind of great (I used to have another clock app, Mornify, but Google took away clock apps permission to use spotify so they could be the only ones with it). Now, this app fn sucks: Alarms don't fire off and if they do is with a default alarm, so I'm always either late or annoyed. And I can't use another app because Google's monopoly on Spotify","Everything you could hope for from a clock, timer, stopwatch, alarm combo. Latest update moved the icons from the top of the screen to the bottom, near where my thumb is. I cannot express how long I've been waiting for apps to make this change! Hope to see more apps do this soon. wish i could reorder my timers. wish the \"pause\" and \"reset\" for timers were closer.","Set alarms do not move to top of list. - Alarms are hard to read\\keep organized. - You can't set them for certain days. (Ex: Can't set an alarm for only Fri, earlier in the week, or \"for every Fri\" You have to rem every Thurs to set it) --- I miss generic phone apps that came with phones (calendar, clock, memo etc). Google apps are janky, and have less settings.","It used to be better. You would open the alarm set up to see current time. Now after the \"update\" some months ago you see the next hour. One have to start with being in the present in order to set an alarm in the future. You've made a design mistake that only YOU can solve. Review and repair please.","I really love the app. Beautiful. Clean. Simple. Every clock app has the basic features. But that's not enough. Every time you wake up the neat and simple alarm is really easy on eyes. Not just that, you can connect it with Spotify and select a playlist. Boy that's not what we find in most other apps.

I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate. A free trial means you don't need to do anything to use it, including making an effort to subscribe. UPD: sorry, my bad. Didn't notice the X button.

For technical help, please email appstore@tunein.com.","comments":["Pretty good app overall, but one major negative is that it loses connection a lot and every time I hit pause, even if it's just for a few seconds, the app makes me listen to a 30 second ad! Very, very very annoying when I'm listening to a live sports game! Please stop being so greedy and fix this issue! Put like a 5 minute grace period in or something reasonable.","Enjoy this application for many years now. However, recently I am having issues with the sleep timer on my favorite radio station. Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","It's a good app, you can access 1000s of stations but one of the joys that made it similar to listening to a real live radio was the sleep timer feature. It's not working on the current version for some reason which is a shame and a pain. Not an issue if listening during the day, I would imagine though.","App often goes into endless cycle of ads and doesn't return to radio station I'm listening to. I understand having ads when I'm not paying for subscription but I just listened to 20 minutes of ads and had to turn off because it won't return to radio station I was listening to. Have to close, reopen, listen to more ads then back to station. And then when radio station returns from its own commercial break TuneIn will suddenly cut to its own ads & begins endless cycle of ads w/o return to station."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"tunein.player","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Smashy Road: Wanted","description":"SMASHY ROAD: WANTED\r\n\r\nYou are WANTED!

So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

I think about half of the players have stopped playing now. What the developers haven't seen, is that if the spenders don't have anyone who doesn't spend to compete with, they won't have to spend as much to get the same rewards, so the game developers wi get less money I hope this change is reverted soon. Thanks.","Decided to play game with friends and family, only to find out moving servers is a total loss (monies already spent and game money in my account) and I would have to start all over. Has been completely disappointing and never a response from games customer support. Don't waste money on this game as can clearly see they do not listen players and have no concern for them. I suggest looking for something more player friendly. Can see how they created empire by stealing from players.","One has to pay too high a price in real dollar$ and game coins for what you're needing to advance while playing this game. I also learned the hard way, that you have very little chance against Ruby players who are unethical bullies, whether they are players and/or Alliances. There's no recourse when players and Alliances do not follow the rules of the game. Also, why can't you play the game without downloading the updates?","After I updated the game it was demanding update again. so I deleted and installed the app to get rid of the bug. Since I couldn't remember my password I requested a password change but I noticed the game server is also changed and my progress is gone. The game can also be laggy most of the times. It is a good old game but not suitable for modern times and it has very bad bugs. most of players are inactive.","It's a good game overall, except when ever the game has it's bugs... Which seems to happen A LOT.... But what surprised me the most, was that this company gave me my money back. This review used to be vary different, I complained about losing money by buying some stuff and not getting it...

You buy the packs and so much of what you buy you never get. Fun game, but \"free play\" sadly isn't much fun as you can't compete and always lose everything when you can't afford shields.","This is a pay to win game. No matter how many free events there are you never going to get what is offered to people who pay. There are people with all over a billion power they will farm you. If you can't be on the game daily even free events aren't going to help. Plan to play for 3 years before you can compete and by then they will be even stronger. Maybe if you had just start up battlefields.","Tell you what, I watched the gameplay of this and I was sold! It looks like toystory meets call of duty!! I downloaded it instantly, looks great!!! Ill give It 5 stars until further notice. Remember, Xbox and Playstation controllers can connect to your android device, so you don't need the touch screen to play! Anymore :D","Well, I saw this game on an ad and I though \"Hey this looks interesting\" but when I actually installed it, it was NOTHING like the ad, it was one of those territory games, but the thing in the ad said that it was a Third Person shooter game like COD or Fortnite, but no it wasn't, talk about a rip-off. Anyways, it was a complete waste of time.","The game takes some time getting used to, however 9/10 times you're going to get attacked by someone three times stronger than you (most likely pays to win), so understanding how to get aegis and leveling up is paramount.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Alarm Clock Xtreme: Alarm, Reminders, Timer (Free)","description":"Wake up gently to your favorite music and avoid accidentally disabling your alarm with Alarm Clock Xtreme Free!

New phone is Android 11, and this app simply won't work. When your screen turns off, the app freezes exactly where it was. E.g: 6 hours and 11 minutes until next alarm? It won't go off, but when you look at it h I urs later, it will still say 6 hours and 11 minutes until next alarm. Such a shame...","So much improvement over the last few years. Actually big time! While I always liked this alarm, I've been one of their harshest critics. I love it when developers listen to customers, and turn things around. Visual themes are so beautiful! Weather, several different ways to wake up. I love the little birdies tweeting a half hour before alarm BRAVO!!","Wonderful working alarm app with cool features to help heavy sleepers out of bed! Lots of options to mess around with as well. My only complaint is that sometimes the alarms will not go off and it has made me late for a couple very important occasions, which is not fun. I don't know why this happens, but I triple check every alarm I set to make sure it's set in fear it won't go off again. I think it happens if I reset the alarm too quickly, and it thinks that I'm cancelling the next, maybe?","Been using this app for years, but I just got a new S21 and it won't override the lock screen on the new phone (2 other alarm apps are overriding just fine). I've tried deleting app data, cleared app cache, reinstalled, ensured all permissions were granted and gave the app permission over the lock screen, but still not working. Then I decide to reach out to tech support in case it's a bug and discovered that support is only available to paid users. So I guess I'll be looking for a new app now.","I've had this app for about 1-2 years. Like that it has a timer and stopwatch. But the ads were getting to be excessive and annoying. And just yesterday the alarm I set didn't go off, causing me to be late for an appt. If that had happened on a day I'm working night shift, that would be a serious problem. Uninstalled. Time for an upgrade."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.alarmclock.xtreme.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alarmclock.xtreme.free&hl=en&gl=us"}]
