Squashed bugs, fine-tuned the look and feel, and made sure you’re ready to keep binging your favorite content. Download the app today!","comments":["After what seems to be a recent update, it has become extremely tedious to rewatch a TV series. It doesn't properly keep track of what episode you're on where you were at and the episode when you go back to watch it again. It will constantly skip full episodes or restart ones that you were already watching instead of resuming from where you left off.","Hulu, you guys and girls coverage of the 2020 Olympics was horrible! 2 days of speed walking really? Your coverage of the real track and field sports was disgusting! YouTube TV here I come. I understand how television works. A lot of the responsibility falls on the networks shoulders like all of the NBC affiliates but you guys are all friends and have had many, many meetings before the Olympics started. It's pretty bad when the best coverage has been on KGW. That's our FREE local NBC channel!","While I love Hulu and appreciate it as a cord cutter. The app on my TV and here never seems to be able to go back to where I left off in series. It doesn't even start up at the episode I left off. If every other app can do this. HULU should be able to also. It's annoying to have to go back and dig for the season, episode and scene I left of at.","Streaming service is great, but the Android app is awful. I'm watching something where I frequently need to pause to read subs of translated onscreen signs or other text. Touching the screen doesn't pause the video. The pause button is small, and only becomes visible after I click the screen. By the time I hit Pause, the caption is already gone, so I have to back the video up, rinse and repeat.","Frustrated that since the last update every time I exit out or I pause and my screen times out, it starts my show over at the beginning. Then I have to sit and wait for the beginning ad to finish before jumping, to hopefully the right spot. It used to remember where I left off and that has changed. I also noticed that my watch history is all jacked. Sometimes it shows a show I watched a week ago, sometimes it shows an episode like 3 episodes ahead. I'm the only one on my account.

It will do the job but make you hate yourself for it. The interface is very heavy feeling and at times a pain to navigate. Its like trying to take a detour with no signs. They have catagories... sorta, but I am convinced it was just a program vomiting content after a night of cheap liquor. It has the vibe of a designed team that remember their assignment 3 hours before the deadline. Bring a GPS you're going to need it to find your way around.","More adds than video content. Often the videos fail, but don't worry the advertisements never do. If you try to rewatch a 10 second clip that recently failed, you'll have to watch the advertisement again, which never fails to run. Unacceptable for a company as large as it is, and owned by Disney. Get it together boys and girls....You should be better than this. I pay a monthly subscription for this, rediculous!","Incredibly terrible app for this size company. Load times are awful, there are 30 second unskippable commercials that freeze, so you wait 2 minutes to watch 25 seconds of content followed by more commercials. The watch app is terrible, I have espn+ membership but I'm unable to watch games that are on broadcast television like ABC, because I don't have a cable membership. Their watch section is laid out terribly and it's vague what you are able to watch with your membership. So bad.","If it weren't a dang monopoly, I would've deleted this app years ago. Slow load times, has no problem loading 40 second ads, but then won't load the 10 second highlight you came to see. But wait, try to find the highlight anywhere else, and it'll kick you back to their app. Please, for the love of God, can yahoo, or fox sports, or literally anyone make a half decent app for sports. I'll take it over this dumpster fire any day","Horrible lag in the app. Also it does a horrendous job playing videos. The big issue is the handoff from ad to content. And even when the video is playing, of you change the time on the video, it won't respond and will skip the video. Would have expected a lot more from a big company, bit the app has bee.

I had to stop and switch to my tablet. It doesn't let you skip ahead to that spot but has to show you every single commercial they've dropped into the movie to get to that point. It was over 10 minutes of commercials to get back to that point! I understand showing one commercial break, but this was unbelievably excessive. Forget it! I'll just wait until I can get back to my TV which is still sitting there on pause (thankfully).","I love this app! It is all free, many Series, Movies, Novels, Etc to see! You can use application or games while you Pluto TV !!! and the ad that appears on TV is the same as the application!!! The app is very good, only that I would like them to put a search engine to be able to search for Series, Movies, Novels, etc. But the app is very good, I give it 5 stars! Thanks Pluto TV :)","I loved this app until yesterday. It crashed & now all I get is the splash screen then a message that says cannot connect, check your connection. There's nothing wrong with my connection as all my other apps work perfectly fine. I've cleared the cache, uninstalled & reinstalled, & restarted my device. Nothing helps so now I can't watch it at all,","When it has trouble playing, it skips important parts of the movie. Trying to pickup where I left off is near impossible. I can only play from the beginning and try to find the spot where it I left off. Every time I do, it plays a string of ads. Also the ads are often much louder than the movie. On the positive side, it has a great selection of movies and shows. It always works with my miracast when Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ will not. Tubi only works with some titles.","I love the app. My reason for 4 stars and not 5 is two fold- I don't mind commercials but there are so many and inconveniently timed as well. My main complaint is there is no search option. I'd love to be able to search the \"on demand\" section to see if a title is available or still available.

If you are in the middle of a commercial interruption and minimize the window, the commercial will remain exactly where you left off but if you are watching a show and minimize the screen, you will be taking back to the beginning of the show and shown more commercials. This just shows how much these people actually care about their viewers. Which I doubt they have any truly loyal viewers. It's like Snapchat. They care more about harassing you with ads, then showing you shows.","I would give your app a five star rating,but I have to be honest! If I'm not honest why bother leaving a review, right?! So, I. gave Crackle 4 stars because the programs are excellent! The ONLY GLITCH IS WITH ANYTHING FREE, YOUR APP HAS LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF ADVERTISEMENTS! APPROXIMATELY EVERY 10 MINUTES OR SO THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF PROGRAM/ MOVIE!! OTHER THAN THIS EXPECTANT GLITCH WITH ANY ENTERTAINMENT APP THAT IS FREE, I COMPLETELY EXPECT THIS! NO HARM NO FOUL!! I STILL ENJOY YOUR APP","Commercials stuck in recycle mode. We couldn't watch the movie because the commercial slot would finish; very, very briefly flash back to the movie; then, immediately, restart the commercial break. The 4th time it instantaneously restarted the commercials, we exited Crackle without finishing the movie! BTW, the commercial break is way too long with too many ads in it. We're deleting Crackle and sticking with TubiTV & PlutoTV.","I watched this really great greatest movie \"The Whistleblower\" Thank you Crackle. I haven't found, \"The Whistleblower\" on any other app. The main character is an amazing actress. This app doesn't take up too much storage space. There's ads but most of the time it's worth it, to get the diversity and range of a selection of movies. This app doesn't require sign in or too many permissions. Lots of free movie with a broad range of a selection It's great.","Insultingly poorly designed \"application\" calling it an app is a stretch of the word as it doesn't even work properly on ultra wide screen phones (21:9, 21.5:9). In all honesty it feels like a very poorly made port of an iphone app designed for one and only one aspect ratio. And this is just the bare framework of the app itself not to mention the abusive advertising \"breaks\". This entire package is one giant step backwards, much like most of Sony's products."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gotv.crackle.handset","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gotv.crackle.handset&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GO Music - Offline & online music, free MV, MP3","description":"Enjoy online & offline music streaming of millions of trending songs on demand.

They removed the \"contiwatching\" so if you are watching a show and exit out of the app, you have to scroll all the way back to the show all the way back to the episode. The app has problems not being able to watch some movies and you have to clear out cache just to get it to work.

Every so often, my downloads mysteriously stop working and I have to remove them and redownload. It happens enough that I will never buy anything else for Google TV. Also, at least one show that I bought has a part of the episode missing. I downloaded it with an excellent wi-fi connection, so that wasn't the issue.","The volume problems are obnoxious. The volume is so low on every video you have to turn the TV up all the way and it still isn't loud enough. You also can only control the volume half the time.

And make sure the ladders are useable if u added them, and b4 the ladders rise up, maybe make a feature like us controlling the ladder in the basket.

It has most of my favorite cartoons from the 80's that I grew up with, like Transformers, G.I. Joe, and even M.A.S.K.!! I'm giving it 5 stars for that alone! But it also has a great selection of news channels, modern TV and flicks, and anime, as well! The amount of ads are very minimal. Anyway, how can you complain about ads, when you're getting a full streaming service for FREE?!?","I love the app there is no loading wait time. I have the app on my phone, tablet and my Roku for my tv. There is so many movies and tv shows to choose from. There are commercials in it however tubi show's the whole movie with no cutouts in it and it's free. I love it and have been watching it for over a year and I'm gonna continue watching it. thank you tubi for all the awesome movie and tv shows.. Jason Finnegan","Love it!! And still love it!! And continue to love it!! I have this along with Prime.. and I watch more here than there!! Edit: I hate to do this.. I watched movies here a lot. But.. evidently, they fixed a bug and now I can no longer watch it because it keeps shutting off every time I try to open it. I have sent 2 messages about this, and no resolution to the problem yet. I need to give them 1 star instead of the previous 5 star review until it's fixed.","Luv it!! I'm binging on so many shows I grew up on that I haven't found anywhere else! Having the captions on most everything is a HUGE plus for me! It allows you to know all the whispering, subtle, & subdued things. My list keeps growing as I always check out the 'also recommend' section below the movie info to what I'm about to watch. I'm surprised my tablet hasn't caught fire because it's ALWAYS on!! My poor games and other apps have been seriously neglected since I discovered Tubi!!","Great TV for free, you can't beat that! I've been watching Tubi for a good while now, and I think it's the best tv app there is. So, if you have a commercial now and again, great free tv, I love it!

Only problem is, it stops working if you don't press any buttons for a while and you have to select the device you're using again. Other than that is great.","It works fine. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is you can't control the volume even when using CEC in a home theater setup. Add that in and it's perfect. I can control volume from Home Assistant, but not this app., that's just sad. ;) (I'm not talking IR volume control, that's entirely different and understandable as to why not.)","Downloaded this app specifically for the private listening feature and I'm disappointed. When the feature works it's great, the problem is it disconnects so often that is annoying. Defeats the purpose of private listening at night when it disconnects. When this happens the whole app stops working not just private listening. If they fix this then I will change this to 5 stars because when it works it's great. Disconnects vary in time periods, could be 5 mins, could be 15 mins etc.. Please fix!!","Very good app, it's one of my favorites...It has never given me any problems...really.. It's pretty easy to get around in the app if you're searching for something, but my very favorite thing about the app is that it can be used as a remote too!!! I cannot tell you how many times I've lost the Roku remote and instead of tearing the house apart like b4 I now just pull the app up on my phone and use it until I find the roku remote under the bed...","App works, but why does it disconnect from the Roku so quickly. Who uses their remote constantly while watching something? You have to reconnect every time you want to use the remote. It makes the app a poor substitute for a proper remote. Of course, I have no choice since my proper remote also stopped working. 🤷‍♂️ If the app is open it should stay connected."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.roku.remote","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roku.remote&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"YouTube Kids","description":"A video app made just for kids\r\nYouTube Kids was created to give kids a more contained environment filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness.

Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

Like you want me to collect two car prizes but there are no cars to collect? Over all I enjoy this game.","The games okay but you really can't play long enough to make much progress. I stopped playing for a long time because the screen was cluttered with so much on top of machine you where playing. Also 99.99% of the time the ad pop-ups for free energy, grabs, etc... never worked. I came back after almost a year to check it out and I see nothing has changed. It has the potential to be a very relaxing de-stressing game to if they would make some screen improvements and fix the ad pop-ups.","Will change to 5 ☆ if the problem gets fixed... This is an awesome game and brings back many memories playing game's like this at the Arcade. But there are a few glitches interfering with this game... The Joy stick gets stuck and moves on it's own and other screen glitches. My friend downloaded it also and she has the same problems with the app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gamecircus.PrizeClaw","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamecircus.PrizeClaw&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"LINE PLAY - Our Avatar World","description":"Be the best you!

By that I mean I've had the game before and the same exact problem happend! Fix this please!","It's a cute app at times, but.. This is the least f2p player friendly app I've come across. If you don't have coins, your options are extremely limited. For example, much of the gacha are coin-based and only some feature diamonds, meaning you get bottom of the barrel items most of the time (if any). On top of that the diamond currency is also hard to acquire. Want to try to get items in events? Sorry! Those aren't very f2p friendly either, disappointed.","here are some things I'd like to see in the game: 1. being able to get the materials you want while trading with neighbors: it'd make crafting a lot more easier 2. the recording button 3. a way of leveling up the VIP status apart from the in-app purchases 4. the daily gems earned watching ads 5. the option to change your LinePLAY birthday to your real one 6.","This game is really the best game I played. But I would give it 5 stars if my account lasted. Everything was working very well when I tried to open it once and it showed me the screen the is shown when you have just downloaded the game. I tried to register my account but it said the my account wasn't even saved in line play. Please fix this I really loved this game and I don't want to uninstall it. I'll be waiting for an answer from the developer and make it fast.","for an expensive game, your staff sure have little care for fixing simple bugs. or is it intentional that you refrain players from watching ads, so they will purchase overpriced game currency? we pay with our time for viewing them, have some decency. frankly, all you have left is good item designs. even the new boss raid requires money to get the nicer prizes. when I said listen to your players for once, I didn't mean to give them more things to SPEND REAL MONEY ON."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"jp.naver.lineplay.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.naver.lineplay.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"HTC Account—Services Sign-in","description":"With HTC Account, sign in to multiple HTC services in one place on your phone.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth! Had huge glitch on my game play, took a couple of weeks to fix, they got it done!!! Thank you all. Awesome job well done. Totally locked in forever. 👍👍 Once again the Tech Team has stepped up to Excellence. Thanks 😊 7.21.21","Fantastic idea ! 2 stars missing because this game does not load properly. Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building. It also have military, airport, railway, minerals, space oruented,....etc 3.In each and every places has unique song i really have enjoyed it. 4.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much!

Going to the developer's website is not helpful either (and it is very unprofessional looking)."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.oovoo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oovoo&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"WWE","description":"Download the WWE app for:\r\n- WWE news and announcements\r\n- The latest results from every pay-per-view, Raw, SmackDown and NXT\r\n- WWE Superstar profiles and title histories\r\n- Access to live event tickets and official WWE merchandise","descriptionHTML":"Download the WWE app for:<br>- WWE news and announcements<br>- The latest results from every pay-per-view, Raw, SmackDown and NXT<br>- WWE Superstar profiles and title histories<br>- Access to live event tickets and official WWE merchandise","summary":"Download the WWE app for the latest news, announcements, results and more!","installs":"10,000,000+","minInstalls":10000000,"maxInstalls":37855133,"score":4.487765,"scoreText":"4.5","ratings":787943,"reviews":228708,"histogram":{"1":58621,"2":14655,"3":27795,"4":69568,"5":617302},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$9.99 per item","size":"18M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"WWE, Inc.","developerId":"WWE,+Inc.","developerEmail":"appfeedback@wwe.com","developerWebsite":"https://www.wwe.com","developerAddress":"1241 E.

As a WWE lifer, I am extremely disappointed. Original Review: ***** - Wonderful app PPVs (new and old) for decades of classic WWF/E, WCW+ content to be found, rarely seen behind the scenes stuff, comedies, documentaries, & of course, pretty much every show & PPV from yesteryear to now.","I will give you a 5 star rating if you either break ties with peacock tv or fix all their issues they are horrible its always buffering can barely watch it, can't rewind or start over from the beginning everything sucks about peacock tv and when you call them out on all their issues they blame your internet well I know its not my internet and if its not that then hum I wonder what the issue is!!","Need to be able to download matches to view off-line. Want ability to search for * vs * rather than having to know the specific ppv Be intuitive rather than pushing specific stars - I Don't Care about Cena, Oldberg or Slowman Stainz AT ALL!","It was working fine on my phone and box but now I can't sign in on them unless it's my roku tv box but I have to wait a week before I see the previous wk nxt which isn't right at all fix it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.wwe.universe","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wwe.universe&hl=en&gl=us"}]
