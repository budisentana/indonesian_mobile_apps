It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going. They need to fix that but is something I could live with it. Using Google pixel 5","Really annoying, possibly due to bugs. The interface was mostly fine. However, I was playing my Spotify via Bluetooth while navigating with Google Maps. I dropped my friends off about a half a block away from the original destination so I no longer needed that destination, yet the interface wouldn't let me enter a new location and the search icon was unresponsive. I didn't want to disconnect my Bluetooth to reset the app since it'd disconnect my music, so I ended up doing my own navigating.","Connection is finicky. And it's not always intuitive which apps or features can be controlled from the device/phone or the car panel. However, it gets the job done, well enough to get a Midwesterner through the heart of Seattle anyway, which I think says something good.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn‚Äôt start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Smashy Road: Wanted","description":"SMASHY ROAD: WANTED\r\n\r\nYou are WANTED!

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a üîê screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Toca Life World: Build stories & create your world","description":"Create stories and build your own world with Toca Life World.

However, i have given it 4 stars because of a glitch that i do not know how to fix. I have made two custom characters, but I can only get one to appear at a time. one will appear, but when i edit the other one so it appears as well the first one vanishes, and can't be found under the stop sign menu. in addition, there are a lot, and i mean a lot of in app purchases, and there is almost nothing for free to play users.","Toca world is an Amazing game! It is full of imagination and creativity. It is a good game for children about the age 6-11. I have played Toca games for about 5 years now and I'm still not bored of it. For a start, when I first played Toca games I loved them! And so when Toca World came out I wanted to play it so bad because all the games were mixed together. For the positives, It doesn't have many ads at all. For the Negatives, you have to pay to expand your world which isn't much of a problem.","I love this app! And the new stuff! But this review Is not mine but is gonna be for my friend. She made a schoolhouse last night or something, Next day (which is today) everything disappeared... Some stuff are not available to get anymore :(. Like she lost the backpack from the gift which is not available anymore (I think?) I really wanna help her out but I dont know how. Soooooo the only way to fix this was telling it in a review! I dont know how you can help but... This was worth it ^_^","There are few complaints I need to make sure get patched. 1, I make 2 characters in the creator. As soon as I go to the floogle place, it only gives me only one character. 2. I put things on the walls, few seconds later it disappears also with other things it happens. Also, it won't let me open boxes. It's annoying because it's with my friend aswell.","I love this app and others do love it to but the only problem is, (why its only 4 stars) is it takes so long to load in the game for me, I have a samsung galaxy if that helps please make it load faster if you can and maybe add more houses? I think everyone would go bonkers if you added new houses and items and new hair styles and clothes, so sorry for only 4 stars but the loading could be better, but I look foreward to playing this game everyday!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tocaboca.tocalifeworld","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tocaboca.tocalifeworld&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Block City Wars: Pixel Shooter with Battle Royale","description":"5..4..3..2..1..

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

This app is amazing... but the issue is. On my galaxy A11, the app works smoothly when I open the app, then after a few minutes staying on the app it starts to lag. When it gets really bad it either locks up my phone, black screen, and or the app closing out by itself... I want to enjoy the full experience of the app because I love to explore. Thank you.","Typing in the search box was impossible. Letters were erasing themselves as I was typing. I updated my Gboard. The same thing happened. Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.) Also a really useful feature would be a wildfire layer in Voyager. Thanks.","Wonderful app. Spend all my time just looking... It's addicting! EDIT : I'm noticing more and more the camera getting clearer on buildings and in cities... I wonder if they plan on going into and inside forests, valleys, and the ocean. I hope so. I suggest one thing-- to notify soneone in the event of a body or something, have that list in the MENU option. Thanks! Love the app.","This app is amazing for analyzing geography, looking for locations, etc. The controls are great and the map itself looks beautiful. HOWEVER it lacks a few key features that the desktop (computer) version has, which leads to it feeling like a downgrade. Lastly the app doesn't have the much loved maps for Luna (Moon) and Mars. I'm not sure if they're on desktop still or not, but either way they should be added ASAP. In fact to be honest, the Luna map was why I downloaded it in the first place."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.earth","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.earth&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"World Building Craft","description":"World Building Craft is #1 sandbox block world crafting simulator.

By that I mean I've had the game before and the same exact problem happend! Fix this please!","It's a cute app at times, but.. This is the least f2p player friendly app I've come across. If you don't have coins, your options are extremely limited. For example, much of the gacha are coin-based and only some feature diamonds, meaning you get bottom of the barrel items most of the time (if any). On top of that the diamond currency is also hard to acquire. Want to try to get items in events? Sorry! Those aren't very f2p friendly either, disappointed.","here are some things I'd like to see in the game: 1. being able to get the materials you want while trading with neighbors: it'd make crafting a lot more easier 2. the recording button 3. a way of leveling up the VIP status apart from the in-app purchases 4. the daily gems earned watching ads 5. the option to change your LinePLAY birthday to your real one 6.","This game is really the best game I played. But I would give it 5 stars if my account lasted. Everything was working very well when I tried to open it once and it showed me the screen the is shown when you have just downloaded the game. I tried to register my account but it said the my account wasn't even saved in line play. Please fix this I really loved this game and I don't want to uninstall it. I'll be waiting for an answer from the developer and make it fast.","for an expensive game, your staff sure have little care for fixing simple bugs. or is it intentional that you refrain players from watching ads, so they will purchase overpriced game currency? we pay with our time for viewing them, have some decency. frankly, all you have left is good item designs. even the new boss raid requires money to get the nicer prizes. when I said listen to your players for once, I didn't mean to give them more things to SPEND REAL MONEY ON."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"jp.naver.lineplay.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.naver.lineplay.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GPS Route Finder : Maps Navigation & Directions","description":"GPS Route Finder : Maps Navigation & Directions provides variety of features such as GPS shortest Route finder, Driving route , Current Location, Maps Navigation, GPS Area Calculator, Distance Calculator, International subscriber dialing (ISD) or Country Codes, City Codes (STD) codes(USA, India, Pakistan), Altitude meter & more - make everything simple and easy! \r\n\r\nGPS Route Finder use GPS & Network to get your position on Map, Helps you Navigate Freely on maps and get you required directions.

Not connecting to Facebook, minus 1 star, so many ads, minus 1 star. Fix those 2 issues and it'll be a 5 star game","A great game but when i play online the play becomes unpredictable. ie gears dont change on time throtel not responsive nos dont work.
