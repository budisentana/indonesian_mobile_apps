So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Exploration Lite Craft","description":"An amazing infinite blocky open world to build, craft and explore.

This help me alot in my difficult situations. But one thing that i want to change is that if person is walking then this also shows the kilometres or speed if it is change according to the activity of an individual like if someone drive a car or who wheeler the small sign is show at the location. If you solve this problem then there to nothing to say any negative point of this application. Thanks.","The ads make this app very creepy. Like you are such an invasive friend and a terrible one if you use this app to check on your friends when they say \"oh battery's dead\" or something. That's creepy. Plus half the things you say in the ad doesn't make sense. Any way you advertise this app is just gonna make it look creepy and kinda stalkerish. Other than that, your replys to most of these reviews are quite nice.","Zenly is a very cool app. I used it every day. After that, I updated the firmware version and now it does not work ... Endless loading on the background of ice cream (after registration and delivery of all permissions). I really want to use it, but I can't anymore... Waiting for help! 🆘","The app is perfect and one thing they should fix is battery optimization if you could add something like sleeping mode which will freeze the location untill we turn it off again. so that battery would not drain faster at that time","At first it was ok, when I update the apps suddenly cannot locate the loaction and its not accurate.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

And then lose, and then have to wait and scrounge all over again until I can play another game of bingo. So thats why no 5 stars.","I'm slightly addicted. Not enough to spend money, but enough to play outside of rewarded play time. I only discovered it through a rewarded play app, trying to win money, not spend it. But, it's a great bingo game. There are many, many fun extras, there's definitely more than meets the eye. There's also a nice variety of ways to earn extra credits but when you're slightly addicted you run through those quickly. All in all, one of the best free bingo apps I've played.","This is my favorite Bingo game. It doesn't get boring but I do think they should give more free chips per day or lower the chips you have to pay per card. I can only play like 3 games per day since I can't afford to spend money on it. I might would spend a few dollars a day if it wasn't so expensive. I think the chips are way to high of a price.","There are so many Bingo apps out that it's hard to choose one. I absolutely love Bingo Bash. (The only other one that is on the same level of fun, for me, is Bingo Pop.) I've leveled up & I'm playing in fun rooms, and contests. My problem is I can never play more than a couple games per day without spending IRL money. Now that I've done that 2x, the prices for a handful of chips soared. I don't win like I did at first either. UPDATE: Since passing level 25, the entire game has changed. 5 stars!","Terrible! You pay for premium cards and still can't win. What a waste! The same people win again and again. The numbers don't make sense that with that many players the same ones win all the time. Also, they need more bingos per game. Is there anything you can buy with all these stupid coins, you should be able to buy bingo chips with them like you can in some other games. The bingos might be randomly called but the SAME PLAYERS keep winning. Even with FOUR PREMIUM cards you can't win."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"air.com.bitrhymes.bingo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.bitrhymes.bingo&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Free Phone Call App, Free Texting + Calling Number","description":"Dingtone, a free calling app allows you to make unlimited free phone calls, send free text messages to anyone.

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"New 2021 Keyboard","description":"You need to get the New 2021 Keyboard now because it surely one of the best keyboard apps with a lots of incredible features:\r\n★ this awesome keyboard for Android allows you to change themes of keyboard app instantly\r\n★ Add a background wallpaper for keyboard from your picture gallery to create your own beautiful keyboard for Android\r\n★New 2021 Keyboard is one of the best apps that change your keyboard\r\n★ improve your keyboard when you create your own keyboard with background, sounds and other features to create one of the most beautiful keyboards\r\n★ the main improvement the 2021 keyboard app contains is the suite productivity features\r\n★ it is quick and easy to choose New 2021 Keyboard as your active keyboard\r\n★ free keyboard themes available for the keyboard new version\r\n★ you access so many features with the best beautiful keypad, an advanced keyboard for Android with privacy!\r\n\r\nWe created New 2021 Keyboard and tried to offer users the ultimate keyboard with an impressive list of features. \r\n\r\nGuaranteed when you get the New 2021 Keyboard:\r\n★ make your own keyboard with a lot of features\r\n★ write easier with this keyboard that can be personalized\r\n★ use the keyboard to chat, send text messages and write emails\r\n★ you can change the font\r\n★ transform the buttons by adjusting their size and shape\r\n★ the New 2021 Keyboard is a fast and safe app\r\n★ it is one of the top keyboard apps this year\r\n\r\nTry it now and change your keyboard with a new version of this beautiful keypad!

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles. Will update my feedback as I continue using it"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.mapswithme.maps.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Pepi House: Happy Family","description":"Meet and greet the huge Pepi family in PEPI HOUSE!

I get chests everyday , I have 1000 diamonds and I also like my daily levels , the reason I love this game is because I get to have featured levels , quests and all for free! That 150 130 gem thing must be a bug. I have also completed half of the featured levels and 5 daily levels. And 82 things like icons , ships ,balls , ufos , waves , robots, spiders , trails , death effects and colors. This one is a little bit better than geometry dash (but not full version) so,yeah!","This game is amazing, theres alot of things to do and its very fun. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because everytime I get diamonds from quests something weird happens. Everytime I leave and come back for some reason I start to loose my diamonds. I used to have 150 diamonds but now I have 130. It's very wierd and annoying but although of that this games is good!","It has amazing music and the obstacles are abstract and colourful, the beat matches every obstacle as well. It's an amazing game, and I recommend it to those who have fast fingers and like electronic music. I have no complaints about this game, so it earns a five-star rating from me. If at First You Don't Succeed, try, try again.","I completed gd world in just 1 attempt, super fun and colorful, different varieties of icons, colors, online+daily lvls, perfect sync, lots of things to collect and most definitely great soundtracks! (in my case I don't get many ads) but there are only 10 lvls and freaking short. Want rob to add more lvls. Anyways, Def 5 stars and suggested to download this app!","I love this app so much.I just dont understand why it just stops working sometimes?When ads come i always click on them and then i go to google play and get back to the game,but sometimes it yeets me to my browser???I dont get why that happens but im on redmi note 8T and i hope thatll be fixed soon.When i enter the app sometimes,Its just a black screen with lighter fazes if grey,and it doesnt work until i reset my phone.Please fix these bugs!!😔💓"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.robtopx.geometrydashworld","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robtopx.geometrydashworld&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate.

It's pretty fun! There's several rooms, enough to keep me busy and entertained. And the characters are also very silly and creative which I like.. like there's robots, astronauts, bubble guys and fish too. The best thing about it was all the stuff there was to grab and click on... And it truly represented a real hospital with all the different areas including the waiting rooms and parking lot where the ambulance pulls in. 👍","my cousin can't play every time my cousin go's in the app. she watches a ad to unlock the rest of the floors but it freezes. and never lets her in the app there's no x button to go back into the game. then she resets the app same thing happened. please fix this for my cousin she plays on tablet by the way. she keeps on bothering me so fix this glitch. Edit: yes I can see the ad I deleted the app then installed it still same thing it's stuck the number the timer that tells you when the ad is over","I would give this game 5 star rating but it isn't PERFECT, its fun and inspires you and this goes for every game of Pepi I m disappointed because I can't have ALL of the levels of the building. You can watch a video but that only gives you 15 minutes to play with every thing. Please fix this and make all levels playable without ha b ing to play","It's fun to know but you have to watch and add every time a timer runs out and it doesn't even give you that much time I would rather just not download the game at all because there's barely any rooms that are free you have to watch ads to get them and the ads are so long I rather you just pay for the entire game then have to watch it at every time you want to play it","This game is amazing! I can take care of patients and heal them if they have broken bones! I can also take care of babies in nursery, and so much more! I love this so much, This is the BEST hospital game ever! And because I wanna grow up to be a doctor, this inspires me even more! I highly recommend this. I can watch an ad to unlock everything for 15 minutes! It's worth it, and I'm very happy with this game! It is so much fun and it's also really educational for kids.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Earth","description":"Explore the whole world from above with satellite imagery and 3D terrain of the entire globe and 3D buildings in hundreds of cities around the world.

This app is amazing... but the issue is. On my galaxy A11, the app works smoothly when I open the app, then after a few minutes staying on the app it starts to lag. When it gets really bad it either locks up my phone, black screen, and or the app closing out by itself... I want to enjoy the full experience of the app because I love to explore. Thank you.","Typing in the search box was impossible. Letters were erasing themselves as I was typing. I updated my Gboard. The same thing happened. Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.)
