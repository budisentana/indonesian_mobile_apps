So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

The sightings still show their original locations, but my list of locations to select from is blank. If I make new locations, my old sightings won't be connected with them.

It serves that function fine. However, it's a TERRIBLE app for listening to audiobooks. I often have to re-listen to chapters I've already heard, bookmarks don't work consistently, sometimes the app stops playing on its own, it doesn't acknowledge the \"pause\" function on my headphones, and there's no way to see where you are in a chapter. I wish there was another app I could use with my library card instead of this one.","I think the app is fine with regard to the books available and the audio output. My concern is the timer. I like to set the timer for thirty minutes at bedtime however I am not able to use the 30 selector in this app because it doesn't turn off. That is until you wake up to readers voice and pause it yourself. Earlier times seem to work, but not the 30,45, or 60 minute setting. Strange. I tried uninstall and reinstall but that didn't fix it. So now I can only listen during the day. Can anyone help with this issue?","I like the app but find the selection of books, especially by popular male authors, is limited. The other irritation is the claim available in so many days but it's not available to me and then another waiting period shows up and then another. I have stayed online and checked every 2 minutes but that doesn't help. I suspect there is a waiting list but it would be better if I could see that 8 people were ahead of me and that the days to available shown in the app were meaningless.","I've enjoyed listening to tons of free audiobooks on this app for a few years now. And all you need is your library card if your local library participates. CL will restrict usage especially towards the end of the month but it's workable. Overall, a very useful app for avid readers/listeners to save a lot of money.","Since your last update, the audiobooks pick up somewhere behind where I left off. Sometimes it's the beginning of the track, sometimes it goes 60% behind where I left off. Sometimes it holds my place if payed and I answer the phone, sometimes it goes back to the beginning. I'm so frustrated! This is the only app my library uses, so I'm forced to use this app. I need the ability to trust the app will hold my place like EVERY OTHER AUDIOBOOK APP!

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly.

Rate the app and leave a review!","comments":["Lately showing incorrect information, which basically makes the app useless. Just watched a passenger jet fly by, looked like a 737. Opened the app and it showed a single engine Pilatus turboprop. Also listed the wrong destination. I'm in the initial approach for HPN where this jet was clearly landing, but listed as heading to Montauk. This happened two other times in the last week. Been using app for years, never had this happen before. I updated app and still showed bad info. What's up guys?","Have enjoyed several years of silver level but notice planes taxiing to runway, waiting for ages, then gone, suddenly airborne at speed and off the screen. Used to be able to track acceleration and liftoff. It needs to be made clearer what times mean. I thought they were local to where the aircraft was, but I think they must be local to where I am, ie Auckland, NZ","I love this App and always use it to identify the Aircraft going in to my local Airport and to follow their journey. I find it very informative and entertaining and would recommend it to anyone with similar aviation interests. Update 6/8: I have just found that a lot of features are accessed by Search Bar and am absolutely loving it now. Upgraded to Silver Package. Well and truly addicted!","I love this app! I have a Gold subscription but as of lately its not picking up all the aircraft thats right above my head.....I can physically hear and see them, but they are not showing in my app...","Love thus App! I use it as part of my daily work as well as personal travel. Ads, when they are shown, are not overly long or constantly interrupting use. Simple and intuitive to use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.flightradar24free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flightradar24free&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Baca - Baca Berita Terkini & Video Humor","description":"BACA merupakan konten aggregator yang mengumpulkan konten dari beragam sumber berita terpercaya dan menyajikannya kepada kamu setiap saat.
