There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit.

Secondly the car is the weak spot, back then you had to target the soft spot to destroy a car wich was challenging now its brainless and needs no effort. Back then I would have given this a 5 star now I would give it 0 it is now pay to win its sad to say because I loved this game","Absolutely loving the game, very entertaining... except, what happened the all the players? The chat thread is empty, I'm seeing nothing but bots (ai enemies) in all my matches, and I can't seem to catch any players in a match... did I do something wrong? Please help me. Edit: I was just running my daily tasks, and I THINK I found a player... idk, I'm beginning to think the game died lol","It's a great and entertaining game for certain but my account was lost due to me signing someone else's google play account out.Now I've lost everything, please fix this.I will ensure to rate five stars if this issue is solved.","For me the upgrades are way to expensive because before I could get everything only with coins and now everything costs these blue coins.

It is not like it used to be. The UI is worse than the old one, everything is too big and to much swiping. I think the licenses to the cars are expired so you can't see any real car badges or even the name. Yeah pretty much it. It is bad now. if you want to play drag racing games, just download CSR or Nitro Nation (which is a CM game, better (3D) version of this game)","I am sorry to say this but this game has become really complicated now with the new menu and interface ,I used to play this game a lot before and I have beaten it many times back in 2016 and beyond , I got say I liked the simplicity of the game when it was new but now it's totally a mess , please revert back the game to the original classic drag racing where navigation was easy and simple and the menu was also very well designed back in the old updates, this new update is a total disappointment.","Terrible game. Very one dimensional. Got tired of falling behind on every launch on 'DRIVERS BATTLE' despite following all the indicators and getting 'perfect launch' message, so I guess I will just not play anymore. If your car isn't maxed for it's level, 'DRIVERS BATTLE' is the only way to grind currency, and it gets old in minutes. The devs have been jacking off for the last what, 7 years now? I think I'll just download hill climb, or better yet, just stare at the wall. thanks for nothing","Disappointed... Back then when this game cannot connect the data to Google Play Games, they help me to recover the lost profile. Then after play it for a loooong time, they upgraded the game so it can connect saved data to Google Play Games. Now they reset it, my old profile built with hours and hours of play...... disappeared.. And the simple game becomes very complicated..","Disappointing game. I am one of your fans but once I get in its said that the game stopped working! please fix this problem and also thx for adding the new modifications to the game.

I could search songs, nothing glitched, it was amazing. But eventually, I wasn't and still aren't able to search songs. The first page it opens when you click on the app, says that the service is offline. And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth! Had huge glitch on my game play, took a couple of weeks to fix, they got it done!!! Thank you all. Awesome job well done. Totally locked in forever. 👍👍 Once again the Tech Team has stepped up to Excellence. Thanks 😊 7.21.21","Fantastic idea ! 2 stars missing because this game does not load properly. Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building. It also have military, airport, railway, minerals, space oruented,....etc 3.In each and every places has unique song i really have enjoyed it. 4.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Prison Escape","description":"Launch the escape plan step by step and break out to prove innocence of yourself in #1 prison themed open world escape game!\r\n\r\nYou are sent to death row due to a conspiracy and the only way to save yourself is to break out the prison from inside.

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Mafia City","description":"▲Compete to become the Godfather in an awesome strategy game that requires wit and time management!\r\n▲Steal from Banks, form alliances with other players, and fight together to take over the City and the Mafia World!\r\n▲Date Cute Babes who cheer you on daily and heroic Crew Members who support you with undying loyalty!\r\n▲It’s a real-time interactive Turf War with daily skirmishes throughout the year!\r\n▲Collect Luxury Cars to impress both enemies and friends!

Its fun and keeps me fairly preoccupied. The biggest issue I have with this game is the customer service. I spend more than my fair share purchasing game packs. The one time I had an issue with mafia city's system updates, I reached out and all I hear were excuses as to why theh are unable to give me back the gold I purchased (by the way).","I'm still giving this five stars. Let me summarize some reviews and clarify some things. This game is fun. You can make friends from all over the world. You have the opportunity to learn different languages, customs, and holidays. There is a lot of money that you can choose to invest. You can also have a lot of fun playing and invest time into developing your game account by spending nothing. At no time do the developers twist your arm to make you spend. Give it a try, but don't be a hater (:","Love this game have been playing it since college in 2014 even friends from the game now on Facebook. Just wish it was easier for you to get resources instead of it taking so much time they need to update that shouldn't take that long if you could move quicker in this game you'd probably have more people playing even though you have to spend money it's still amazing 💯✊🏾","To exspensive once you get past a certain level and the in game GM sucks at responding to messages. My leader went from 27-30 and got no rewards at all for it and now i can't look at my messages or items while in city view gotta go to my mansion view to look at them collect rewards donate to clan ect... And as always GM doesnt respond back. Lower the prices and fix the game! Its getting annoying!!","Pretty good experience . Didn't require much money to gain rank and power. I enjoyed myself.

For example, much of the gacha are coin-based and only some feature diamonds, meaning you get bottom of the barrel items most of the time (if any). On top of that the diamond currency is also hard to acquire. Want to try to get items in events? Sorry! Those aren't very f2p friendly either, disappointed.","here are some things I'd like to see in the game: 1. being able to get the materials you want while trading with neighbors: it'd make crafting a lot more easier 2. the recording button 3. a way of leveling up the VIP status apart from the in-app purchases 4. the daily gems earned watching ads 5. the option to change your LinePLAY birthday to your real one 6.","This game is really the best game I played. But I would give it 5 stars if my account lasted. Everything was working very well when I tried to open it once and it showed me the screen the is shown when you have just downloaded the game. I tried to register my account but it said the my account wasn't even saved in line play. Please fix this I really loved this game and I don't want to uninstall it. I'll be waiting for an answer from the developer and make it fast.","for an expensive game, your staff sure have little care for fixing simple bugs. or is it intentional that you refrain players from watching ads, so they will purchase overpriced game currency? we pay with our time for viewing them, have some decency. frankly, all you have left is good item designs. even the new boss raid requires money to get the nicer prizes. when I said listen to your players for once, I didn't mean to give them more things to SPEND REAL MONEY ON."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"jp.naver.lineplay.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.naver.lineplay.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Top Speed: Drag & Fast Racing","description":"Dominate your criminally insane rivals in extreme head-to-head drag races!\r\n\r\n• Pick from 69 cars: stock rides, dragsters, and police vehicles\r\n• Let your creativity flow through a ton of tuning and customization options\r\n• Drive in 5 city districts, each with its own unique theme and gang crew\r\n• A real-life inspired aircraft carrier to race on\r\n• Epic arcade game modes\r\n• Adrenaline inducing Most Wanted police chases\r\n• Mind-blowing 3D HD visuals\r\n\r\nReach impossible speeds by expertly timing gear changes and bursts of nitro\r\nTop Speed is setting the new standard within drag racing genre.

No repairs, and no need to wait. But now, I installed it on the same phone but different account. It doesn't work now, and I don't know why. It says \"you have no internet access\", which is ironice, since I am on internet. But when I go to my original account, it works, so I'm not sure why. Edit: Doesn't even work anymore.","I'm a lil disappointed with this game. It's \"realistic\" in a somewhat awful way. Immediately I make a turn, car almost comes to a complete halt!! There's no way to drift. Club feature doesn't make much sense; I can't race with club members","First of all, I don't understand why people hate this game just because of it's sim-cade graphics. Gameloft has done a good job with the physics of the game and the quality of such a game coming from 2012 is just so underrated. The physics of the game is sim cade and is easy for beginners. New cars and new locations can be added too. Recently, there has also been a big in which the game runs in 2X speed. I hope the devs take care of this issue","My queston is why did some of the cars get removed, and why did my FAVORITE SONG get removed? (The car amount used to be 81 acording to one of pictures) [example: tesla model S which had B class] i remember when i played this in 2017... Why would those cars and song get removed? (This is making me sad...) :( I dont know what the reason is for those things getting you know, removed. If these things come back, I would be very happy, but no one, including me will ever know. If they are back, 5*","Guys, in overall graphics, gameplay, controls, cars, views, maps and the mechanics itself is a BIG \"THUMBS UP\" literally as a car enthusiast, I could say that this is one of the best car game that've made... Outstanding! I have no other words to say but literally Brilliant!!! It really gives you a real car experience... Keep up the good work guys!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftRAHM","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftRAHM&hl=en&gl=us"}]
