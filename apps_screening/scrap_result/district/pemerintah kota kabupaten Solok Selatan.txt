How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home. So, instead of just opening the tracker in another browser tab, the developers in their infinite wisdom have decided that it is better if you unlock your phone, open the app, and then be able to locate.

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Don't need to spend if you know how to use the pop out ads to accumulate free grabs. Doesn't bore on scenery and accessories, but could use a more realistic prize display lineup, maybe a elimination mode and multiplayer mode. Also add some music and some interactive elements please! Great game regardless of the these minor flaws but I'll grab my claws now!!!!!!","This game is exciting and engaging for those who love claw games.In real claw machines,it is very difficult and rare to get a prize.However,the game developers make the game easier for players to collect prizes and even trade for more fun prizes.Lastly,thank you for making this game offline so that I can play it anytime!Keep up the good work!","A bit janky but it's a great time passer. A few issues, like too many coins built up I wish they had a rest on the prizes, also how am I supposed to do the task when the prize isn't there? Like you want me to collect two car prizes but there are no cars to collect? Over all I enjoy this game.","The games okay but you really can't play long enough to make much progress. I stopped playing for a long time because the screen was cluttered with so much on top of machine you where playing. Also 99.99% of the time the ad pop-ups for free energy, grabs, etc... never worked. I came back after almost a year to check it out and I see nothing has changed. It has the potential to be a very relaxing de-stressing game to if they would make some screen improvements and fix the ad pop-ups.","Will change to 5 ☆ if the problem gets fixed... This is an awesome game and brings back many memories playing game's like this at the Arcade. But there are a few glitches interfering with this game...

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self.

Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Fishing Clash","description":"High time to go fishing!

With that being said the instructions could be better explained and the different aspects of game play because im still not sure im doing it right and ive been playing for awhile. Also it seems like in order to get any good perks or anything you have to buy stuff, i know yall have to make the monies but i would like a choice or not and still be able to get somewhere in the game.","Love this fishing game by far one of the best and reminds me of the one that you used to play back in the day on PlayStation! Literally brings back memories, oh and you can go fishing and all your favorite islands and beaches. It's like going on a little virtual vacation and going fishing right at the touch of your hands.. the only thing I would change is how long it takes you to upgrade and get your licenses! It also glitches out and you repeatedly catch the same fish over an over please fix!!","Now I remembered why I deleted this game before. It really takes the fun out of fishing for real. Sets you up with theses challenges and championship knowing how it's computerized so you won't win. A joke.","It's an ok game. It's fun to catch all kinds of different fish and be able to move onto different areas, but the championship system is unbelievably flawed, and that's really the only way you can progress (other than free packs which give you only 4 different lure cards and make attempting to upgrade anything dreadfully slow). Why am I put up against people that have literally 5 times as many trophies as me, basically finished the game, and have a Lvl. 7 rod where I only have a 3?","the update causes so many freezes and stalls... can't play game. Check your balances - I'm sorry to say I've been shorted power-ups, fish, credit for achievements..basically everything. I must say, the graphics- the talent it took to create this game is awesome, imo, and it's a shame to see such excellent work misused. finally, where's the USA flag on newly updated intro screen??🤨 Uninstalled & following up. crooks Thank you for the attention TenSquare; too bad it took public exposure to get it"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tensquaregames.letsfish2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tensquaregames.letsfish2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Likee Lite - Let You Shine","description":"Likee lite is the lite version of Likee.

The different game modes are awesome, and the reward system is generous. The Hero/Villain Roster is amazing! I was playing SW:GOH, for years and the developers ended up ruining the game over the years. They focused more on making money rather than keeping it fun. The rewards became very slim. But, if this games stays the way it is with great reward drops, and fairly priced in-game purchases, I'll play this game everyday, and I'll gladly recommend it to everyone I can.","Amazing game. Is not a money grab like the avengers game. It be cool if they can bring some new cools updates. Such as Allowing to invite random people to an alliance. Able to join a random alliance. Heroic mode cost a lot of energy so there a limit of how much you can play. Overall is an amazing game. But the game might need more funding and cool features to get more players Still derseve 5 starts","Been playing for 4 years or more daily (absolutely love it). Best mobile game to date. Very in depth rpg system. Every battle can be different with tons of different play styles. We'll over a 100 characters maybe even nearing 200 now. You can play this game daily for 10 minutes or a few hours to get daily challenges it's all up to you. Or you can play in few minute increments if your a busy worker. Not pay to win, paying only helps you boost a little faster but not necessary. Favorite game!","Great game, especially for beginners, but the grind is made too long and most characters become useful only after certain Legendary Skills have been unlocked, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money very early on you won't have these abilities that make most characters good, also energy goes way too fast, and instead of having a node be playable without recharging it 3 times make it 5, a too hardcore grind right off the bat will make some players quit the game","I've been playing faithfully for three years, got all the characters, was really strong, then they go and add one character (Black Flash) that makes it where you can't do anything and die every single time. It was great until they added that character. TONE DOWN BLACK FLASH SO WE CAN DO PLAY INSTEAD OF ALL CHARACTERS BEING DEFEATED BEFORE WE CAN EVEN DO ONE ATTACK!!!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.wb.goog.dc.legends","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.dc.legends&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Airport City - transport manager","description":"Airport games are a true adventure, and Airport City is among the best!

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful.

Amazing graphics and great quality! Fits perfectly for any age aswell. For a start, I have played this game for 3 whole years and there's been no lags, no glitches and the game has never froze. For the positives I really appreciate that when there's going to be an add, They inform you about it at the bottom of your screen. For the Negatives all I would say is could say is could you please add more backgrounds for your character. Other than that it's a brilliant game! 🥰","This game is so fun and exciting to play.My friend and I have been playing it for a while and we decided to make an review to give you ideas to upgrade the game like making it an online game that you can play and add your friends,with mics to communicate with eachother, and to trade plushies.It would be amazing if you can do that to make the game much more fun and exciting.","This is A good Game for Children and teens. But other than that, There's too much ads and the glitches are creepy. Once that I was playing Gacha life. Suddenly An ad came And the Characters were the same. Also the Characters name is \"character\" so I left the game and Replayed it. Then everything was fine. But.. Can you please fix this? it would be Helpful.","I love the app!,it's very useful to make a channel and there is so many stuff you can use you on your avatar!,but I hate that they removed so many things,like poses that was useful. I know that we all have gacha heat but at least a pose that is grabbing something while sitting and a tongue out no?,please add some of the old features and this will be really good app.","Great game! I still dont understand why people use this game in the wrong way. Something that would be cool is that you can add something where you can take a picture of yourself and it will create a similar character. Or there could be a contest thing where you create your own clothing, upload it to the game, and it could be created into actual clothing you can use in the game!Why did I rate it 4 stars? I just tried to log on but it just came up with a white screen!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"air.com.lunime.gachalife","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.lunime.gachalife&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ice Age Village","description":"Embark on a fun and frozen journey through the Ice Age universe.

I'm now waiting a month at a time to simply expand my village and that's all I CAN do. I can't buy anything, no room, and if I do I have to wait another 2 weeks to expand so, great game but it gets exhausting waiting to expand all the time because it is so so so so expensive. Would b 5 stars if it weren't for that.","Hi I'm Giving this a two star 🌟 only because now when I play in collecting my coins and stuff and doing what I have to do to level up but once in a few minutes maybe seconds I get ads It will stop and then give me another one and it's just not worth the hassle for me so please explain why I'm getting ads? Or does anyone else gets ads great game I love it just the ads are annoying","Amazing game, but a little bit expensive. Anyways, the only improvement I need is that I want the things I buy to already have their permanent places because moving them is a hassle and I do not like unorganized things so...😬","it's a money pit after around 50 90% of animals you have to use acorns which you have to buy. you only have about 12 toys for the critters to play, decoration is not much better, I think once you buy in the VIP club you get more animals and decorating and toys. all they want is more money . It stopped giving the free acorns. And I lost my game and cannot find it so I had to start over.","I've always loved the game but the constant asking to update with another game found on the cloud is so annoying as it takes you some levels back.

What a waste of time it was you need different speed ups for different things like troops for example there is no generic speed up for all troop types but multiple types of speed ups you can only use for certain class plus for me to progress from where I left I have to spend a tonne of money I cant upgrade or do research unless I buy packs this is not a free to play game. It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!! And for the RICHIE RICH PEOPLE out there that loves to spend $$$$$ then go play Mobile Strike Gaming and you'll feel right at Home then tooo!!!!
