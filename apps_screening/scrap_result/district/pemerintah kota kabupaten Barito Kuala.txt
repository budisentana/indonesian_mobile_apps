Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"cara cek KTP dan KK Online 2020","description":"Cara Cek NIK KTP Elektronik (E-KTP) Online via Internet\r\n\r\nSebagai Warga Negara Indonesia (WNI) yang sudah berusia minimal 17 tahun, Kartu Tanda Penduduk (KTP) adalah hal wajib.\r\n\r\nHal ini juga berlaku bagi Warga Negara Asing (WNA) yang memiliki Izin Tinggal Tetap (ITAP) dan sudah berumur 17 tahun atau sudah pernah/telah menikah, geng.\r\n\r\nNah, apakah kamu sudah punya E-KTP?

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate.

Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building. It also have military, airport, railway, minerals, space oruented,....etc 3.In each and every places has unique song i really have enjoyed it. 4.

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly.

No matter how many free events there are you never going to get what is offered to people who pay. There are people with all over a billion power they will farm you. If you can't be on the game daily even free events aren't going to help. Plan to play for 3 years before you can compete and by then they will be even stronger. Maybe if you had just start up battlefields.","Tell you what, I watched the gameplay of this and I was sold! It looks like toystory meets call of duty!! I downloaded it instantly, looks great!!!

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More).

Can't search the exact content, but pushing many under quality videos, it is like a promoted channel. I tried now several times to edit settings, same result. Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included . This will limit their use on mobile ."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Pepi Hospital: Learn & Care","description":"Step into a PEPI HOSPITAL and become doctor, patient or just a curious explorer!

It's pretty fun! There's several rooms, enough to keep me busy and entertained. And the characters are also very silly and creative which I like.. like there's robots, astronauts, bubble guys and fish too. The best thing about it was all the stuff there was to grab and click on... And it truly represented a real hospital with all the different areas including the waiting rooms and parking lot where the ambulance pulls in. 👍","my cousin can't play every time my cousin go's in the app. she watches a ad to unlock the rest of the floors but it freezes. and never lets her in the app there's no x button to go back into the game. then she resets the app same thing happened. please fix this for my cousin she plays on tablet by the way. she keeps on bothering me so fix this glitch. Edit: yes I can see the ad I deleted the app then installed it still same thing it's stuck the number the timer that tells you when the ad is over","I would give this game 5 star rating but it isn't PERFECT, its fun and inspires you and this goes for every game of Pepi I m disappointed because I can't have ALL of the levels of the building. You can watch a video but that only gives you 15 minutes to play with every thing. Please fix this and make all levels playable without ha b ing to play","It's fun to know but you have to watch and add every time a timer runs out and it doesn't even give you that much time I would rather just not download the game at all because there's barely any rooms that are free you have to watch ads to get them and the ads are so long I rather you just pay for the entire game then have to watch it at every time you want to play it","This game is amazing! I can take care of patients and heal them if they have broken bones! I can also take care of babies in nursery, and so much more! I love this so much, This is the BEST hospital game ever! And because I wanna grow up to be a doctor, this inspires me even more! I highly recommend this. I can watch an ad to unlock everything for 15 minutes! It's worth it, and I'm very happy with this game! It is so much fun and it's also really educational for kids. I give this a 10/10!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.PepiPlay.PepiHospital","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PepiPlay.PepiHospital&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google News - Top world & local news headlines","description":"Google News is a personalized news aggregator that organizes and highlights what’s happening in the world so you can discover more about the stories that matter to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nStay up to date on your interests\r\n\r\n• The For You tab delivers the top stories across all your favorite topics and sources in one place.

When I clicked 'turn off', it turned off the subject, not the source.","There is a bug where clicking on the article from the android home screen makes the link disappear. So additional clicks on the article does nothing. This bug has been around for at least 3 years. Every morning I wake up hoping that an update fixes it, every morning I am disappointed.","This apps can cause my phone to reset and go into hang state. I have to do manual reset to recover.

It's not like other games where you are forced to watch ads to do anything, so that's a huge plus. I can never get bored of this game and I'm in love with the character designs and the graphics and everything about it. There is a power system, stopping you from playing for hours and hours, but I like it because then I can get out and do things, instead of being a couch potato. Thanks for creating such an amazing, fun, game!","The Game is well designed in appearing the smallest deatails of each character, however each variant of the charter all ways has the same special 1 and 3, to make it appealing and interesting you could change the super speacial to something a little different to other character. The survivor mode is fun but the wheel of fortune is not balanced in terms of probability, i tend to get more crystals then any other prize on the wheel. But over all its a whell designed game.","This game is epic I love how it is offline because all offline games are soo boring unlike this one. I think there needs to be an update and include more player though. On my tablet this game is perfect but on my phone for some reason after I've played a battle it goes off the game and into my home screen so I never get my XP and have to do the fight again but it still takes my energy bars and the process repeats so I dont move on.

First of all in the online battle when i ranked in the top 20 i didnt recive any reward..... I waited for quiet some time but still did not recieve anything.

That is not enough time, and to automatically start charging your Google Play account, I thought this app had a free version. I can't get to the free version. What ever happened to \"try before you buy? Edit: OK, it is possible to kill both\" free trial offer\" screens and try the app, just a lot of ads. I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate. A free trial means you don't need to do anything to use it, including making an effort to subscribe. UPD: sorry, my bad. Didn't notice the X button.

The arrival/ departure times for CTA trains could be a bit clearer. Think Ventra app. Has a comprehensive selection of bus and rail routes but the time displays are difficult to understand. Having a list of departure / arrival times would help tremendously. All in all a good transit reference app and I like it. I'll give it more stars when I get used to it.","This is a good app, but resent update that brought ads just horrible. Ads that jump at me right when I press the button to start a bus ride, when I need to scan a QR code on the bus station and get in the bus I get a full screen pop up. Your decision just forced me to move to other app. Good luck with this. I was loyal user but for now I am out.","The app can be very helpful, but arrival times can be a bit off which can be annoying if you don't plan around it. Another big problem I have with the app is that it's downright unusable when in dark mode. Many elements of the UI don't properly transition to a brighter color when in dark mode and are unreadable, and switching back to light mode is annoying. All and all I would say the app is a4/5 on light mode and a 1/5 on dark mode","I've enjoyed this app for years over my local government's attempt at an app, but the advertisements have become a problem. When it's crunch time and you need to check on buses with a sense of urgency, having a full page ad (usually of another map app?? WHY??) that has to load, then be exited, has actually screwed me several times.","So confusing to look at all I want to do is search for and find out a bus time, it's just far too fussy,. Update Developer response saying this is in the lines tab. How would I be expected to know that? . I am looking for a bus time / route. I know nothing about bus lines and which services they operate. A simple search box with destination and from would suffice, just as when I book a train."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tranzmate","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tranzmate&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"The New York Times","description":"Understand the world around you with original reporting from The New York Times.

Reach out at android@nytimes.com with any questions, comments or other feedback.","comments":["The ads are inconvenient: I am a paying subscriber and I don't want creepy ads. Today the video ad turned itself on without my tapping it, and turned off the music I was listening to in the background. The search function is terrible. Sometimes I cannot find a recent article to reread, even if I search with a key phrase I remember from the title.","The app works just fine. Anytime my Android is on, I can go on the app and read the articles with no problem. The categories are Most Popular, World News, U.S. News, Politics, Business, New York News, Sports, Arts, Magazine, Photos, Technology, Health, Science, Climate and Environment, Food, Books, Movies, Theater, Style, Celebrity Weddings, Travel, Real Estate, Automobiles, and National Obituaries. There are no pop-ups unless I want them.","There is simply no coverage of the country, and the world, that matches that of the Times. While I find many of the Top stories on SmartNews interesting, the online renderings of the Times and the Washington Post, provide me with the majority of the news (other than that in Tulsa and Oklahoma) I find both interesting and useful.","I would put 5 stars for content. However the app is so bad and useless, that it is a one star. If you are not connected to the internet, forget about reading the times offline. It just doesn't work. So forget about enjoying the times on your Android tablet or ipad in the train, plane or the park if wifi is unavailable. Thinking of stopping my subscription as it is a frustrating app","Greatest U.S. newspaper going, BUT, if you plan to access on an Android device, even new tablets, FORGET IT. The app freezes, locks you out, dishes epic amounts of ads -- poorly formatted and that interfere with content. I tried for months to resolve via costomer service. NYT is excellent at responding to complaints, not so good at following up. Please read other negative reviews, you'll find there's a theme centered around the app. Again, best paper going - with an app that will drive you nuts."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.nytimes.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nytimes.android&hl=en&gl=us"}]
