Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much! Saying that the local news I receive is great and helps keep me up-to-date!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.particlenews.newsbreak","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.particlenews.newsbreak&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

I think it deserves 5 stars but I have an issue. It is a bit different from Google, not just talking about its visuals. When I want to open a site from photos, it doesn't have a option. When we click on people also search for, we start getting more similar questions but it doesn't provide that. But since I needed it, I tried to install Google but it always says I can't because I have a similar app. I need you to do something about it. Beside that, it is totally awesome!","I use this because it's not as bloated as google, but there's some really stupid features. Like the fact it keeps telling me that I made an illegal request by modifying my search. Or how when I'm browsing links from the search results, it suddenly has connection issues and hangs, or how about giving users the ability to shut off lite mode? And finally, the home button is in the worst possible place for a tablet because I often accidentally hit the button when I set my tablet down every time!!!!","Keeps popping up a box saying Google lite is ready even though I have it turned off, super irritating, also don't like the auto word fixing during search, leaving me to go back and make changes while it leaves actual misspelled words in the search but changes the words that I made sure to be entered exactly as they need to be to find that info. I avoid it unless I need to use the saved log in info. Plus it has a constant feed that can't be stopped, if you touch anywhere it goes there","Far out one of my best I always prefer google is really awesome for some reason I feel good having and dealing google apps well that's me . Just makes me feel like we're on same frequency's and that's exactly why I'm satisfied even though trying other apps. I end up on same place. so don't get me wrong the mayority off times it has being a tremendously learning Exp. Nevertheless I find my self more. comfortable with google. and you might say I'm a freak not at All I'm Loyal. It's how I operate.","A little notification box pops up that says Google lite is ready now. It forces you to use it, even though the information you wanted already came up. It will continue to loop like this if you continue to search for more things.If you do select Google lite, it starts the search over from the beginning, despite the progress you have made. This is annoying, and wastes time. Hate the harsh white background. Would prefer a dark one. Would also prefer more options in the app feature."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.searchlite","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.searchlite&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"MapFactor Navigator - GPS Navigation Maps","description":"* Best rated free offline navigation app on Google Play with 35 mil+ installs*\r\nNow for Android Auto as well!\r\n\r\nMapFactor Navigator is a free GPS navigation app with free offline maps from OpenStreetMaps (incl. free monthly maps update).

That's a problem. Also it does not matter what channel or volume you set in the app the voice engine will cut out source audio. You can have the voice or you can have silence but you can't navigate to a point and listen to anything without interruption. Unless there is a solution the developer will not share this app is not ready for Primetime.","Maps not bad (OSM); interface/search atrocious. Example: asks for country; type United it prompts with Kingdom, back up, type States - frowny face. Must type name of state, which isn't a country. When you get a possibility there is no \"show on map\" except in various unfathomable contexts. Getting beyond Last Search takes gymnastics and a few MAJOR shopping centers in my area not in database. So, free, navigation OK, UI big flunk. Needs real user input + UI/workflow redesign. Coulda been great.","This is the worst GPS app I have used in recent memory. It soaks up ALL the phone's resources FOR NOTHING. the navigation is horrible as well, if you ever get the thing to find an address. It will not adjust to the addition of way points, instead it just tacks them to the end and NOTHING you do changes that. I paid for the maps, and I WILL GET THAT MONEY BACK. I don't put in \"coordinates\", I enter an address via standard American Address format. i.e. number street, city, state, zip. I also placed markers for \"start\" and \"stop\" directly on the map. Doesn't matter how I found start and destination, it drained my battery to nearly dead in a matter of Minutes, and every time (without exception) I tried to search a route it would lock up.","The free/trial version does not even allow searching for a destination by name; I guess what is called \"online search\" in the premium/paid version.

It is time consuming to find a house but fustrating to read about a house that was a no way not ever - over and over and over and over and over and over...get the point?","As I'm in the market to buy, the app has been invaluable. But I wish there was a way of removing listings from suggestions. If I view a home and decide it's not for me, I should have a way to stop seeing it appear on my suggestions. F/I a beautiful 4bd2bth at 90k but it's in a high crime or flood zone. I can favorite, but I can't refuse to see it.","Seems to be getting worse instead of better. I like that I can go to the listing and it's accurate. I wish every listing would be consistent in showing the rental Zestimate at the top or show unavailable if it isn't. The information is usually accurate and I like that there is a link to the county website for the property I'm looking at. The worst thing recently is that I can't update my property info without a real estate agent. Also miss the option to see public view on claimed homes.","Really like the zillow app, would be nice if the app alerted me when someone makes an offer on a property I saved. Would like to get into bidding wars on properties I want to buy. Missed many properties I would have paid more for. Would like to see properties sold on an ebay type format once qualified. Agents are not good about answering questions or making contact through zillow.","Doesn't work anymore. I get an email notification of a new house on the market, but when I click the link the app doesn't open that house. Instead it opens a list of hypothetically related houses. It honestly looks like an embedded web page, and behaves like one. It doesn't scroll properly buttons don't work.

I could search songs, nothing glitched, it was amazing. But eventually, I wasn't and still aren't able to search songs. The first page it opens when you click on the app, says that the service is offline. And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"MAPS.ME ‚Äì Offline maps, travel guides & navigation","description":"Fast, detailed and entirely offline maps with turn-by-turn navigation ‚Äì trusted by over 140 million travelers worldwide.\r\n\r\nOFFLINE MAPS\r\nSave mobile data, no internet is required.\r\n\r\nNAVIGATION\r\nUse driving, walking and cycle navigation anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL GUIDES\r\nSave you time planning the trip and never miss an interesting place with our ready-made travel guides.

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles. Will update my feedback as I continue using it"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.mapswithme.maps.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Wikipedia","description":"The best Wikipedia experience on your Mobile device.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. üòê","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"The New York Times","description":"Understand the world around you with original reporting from The New York Times.

Today the video ad turned itself on without my tapping it, and turned off the music I was listening to in the background. The search function is terrible. Sometimes I cannot find a recent article to reread, even if I search with a key phrase I remember from the title.","The app works just fine. Anytime my Android is on, I can go on the app and read the articles with no problem. The categories are Most Popular, World News, U.S. News, Politics, Business, New York News, Sports, Arts, Magazine, Photos, Technology, Health, Science, Climate and Environment, Food, Books, Movies, Theater, Style, Celebrity Weddings, Travel, Real Estate, Automobiles, and National Obituaries. There are no pop-ups unless I want them.","There is simply no coverage of the country, and the world, that matches that of the Times. While I find many of the Top stories on SmartNews interesting, the online renderings of the Times and the Washington Post, provide me with the majority of the news (other than that in Tulsa and Oklahoma) I find both interesting and useful.","I would put 5 stars for content. However the app is so bad and useless, that it is a one star. If you are not connected to the internet, forget about reading the times offline. It just doesn't work. So forget about enjoying the times on your Android tablet or ipad in the train, plane or the park if wifi is unavailable. Thinking of stopping my subscription as it is a frustrating app","Greatest U.S. newspaper going, BUT, if you plan to access on an Android device, even new tablets, FORGET IT. The app freezes, locks you out, dishes epic amounts of ads -- poorly formatted and that interfere with content. I tried for months to resolve via costomer service. NYT is excellent at responding to complaints, not so good at following up.

Articles are slow to load, but that's okay, though I'd expect more. However something that's very problematic is that sometimes opening a notification won't open the article.

But nearly every time I try to open a story it tells me I've already met the month's quota, even if I haven't used the app in months. It's useless as a news app if you can't read the news. I only use it for headline alerts now, which I then read on other mediums.","Update : App adds freeze and transition from app adds to the content is a very unstable, constantly freezing. Still annoying app. Update: Live TV got much better. Thank you, tech people. It's a ok app. Needs to get tweaked to get Live TV feature, right. I don't do tweaking. So I don't watch Live TV. Only stream past video shows and Live Radio is a ok. The app was working fine for about weeks and in the of June, it's back to \"freeze between transitions\" from news to ads and back to the news."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bloomberg.android.plus","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bloomberg.android.plus&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Injustice: Gods Among Us","description":"Build an epic roster of DC super heroes and villains and get ready for battle!

It's not like other games where you are forced to watch ads to do anything, so that's a huge plus. I can never get bored of this game and I'm in love with the character designs and the graphics and everything about it. There is a power system, stopping you from playing for hours and hours, but I like it because then I can get out and do things, instead of being a couch potato. Thanks for creating such an amazing, fun, game!","The Game is well designed in appearing the smallest deatails of each character, however each variant of the charter all ways has the same special 1 and 3, to make it appealing and interesting you could change the super speacial to something a little different to other character. The survivor mode is fun but the wheel of fortune is not balanced in terms of probability, i tend to get more crystals then any other prize on the wheel. But over all its a whell designed game.","This game is epic I love how it is offline because all offline games are soo boring unlike this one. I think there needs to be an update and include more player though. On my tablet this game is perfect but on my phone for some reason after I've played a battle it goes off the game and into my home screen so I never get my XP and have to do the fight again but it still takes my energy bars and the process repeats so I dont move on.

First of all in the online battle when i ranked in the top 20 i didnt recive any reward..... I waited for quiet some time but still did not recieve anything.

Very, very very annoying when I'm listening to a live sports game! Please stop being so greedy and fix this issue! Put like a 5 minute grace period in or something reasonable.","Enjoy this application for many years now. However, recently I am having issues with the sleep timer on my favorite radio station. Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","It's a good app, you can access 1000s of stations but one of the joys that made it similar to listening to a real live radio was the sleep timer feature. It's not working on the current version for some reason which is a shame and a pain. Not an issue if listening during the day, I would imagine though.","App often goes into endless cycle of ads and doesn't return to radio station I'm listening to. I understand having ads when I'm not paying for subscription but I just listened to 20 minutes of ads and had to turn off because it won't return to radio station I was listening to. Have to close, reopen, listen to more ads then back to station. And then when radio station returns from its own commercial break TuneIn will suddenly cut to its own ads & begins endless cycle of ads w/o return to station."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"tunein.player","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Chat & Date: Dating Made Simple to Meet New People","description":"Chat & Date is the most easy to use dating app to help you find amazing people near you, and let them find you too ‚ù§Ô∏è\r\n\r\n See how popular you and your friends are, as well all of the great people nearby, wherever you may be; at a music festival, on a college campus, or hanging out in the city ?.

Stopped fully loading a while back. Now it doesn't even get past the load screen saying you are using chat and date offline. It wont even let me delete the old profile. Yes I tried have uninstalling and reinstalling. This is just a garbage app dont waste time on it.","It's definitely better than many other dating apps and has a bit more to offer. More people using this than other apps, which makes this app more useful than others, duh. I'm not too happy about losing $50 for a premium subscription I don't recall using but that might just be my own failing mind's fault. I have a bad memory. Customer service is quick to act and helpful, although the terms and conditions are not too great. Overall, second best after Tinder. If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would.","Overall, the app is not bad, but why should I give it one star, just because I don't like it. Let's put it this way, I think it's too complicated, so complicated that people like me who are used to using dating apps are a little confused at first. for example, I was asked too many questions to make an account. who wants to waste their time on this? And, when I found out that it was powered by baddo, I immediately uninstalled it. After all, it's an independent app made by a professional group.","Bring back read receipts. This was one of my favorite dating apps just because of this feature. Now you want to charge for it? I've been using the app for years and lately the quality has been decreasing.","It's amazing.

Best part is that you dont have to upgrade your bot really to beat the boss, maybe just one or two. Also, no need to really purchase anything, just do good combos. The only bad thing is that you have to get google play so if you delete it you dont have any progress, make sure you save the progress!! To help you if you have trouble winning, purchase these robots: UWI Ambush UWII Six Shooter WRB I Gridlock WRB Albino WRB- Metro Gold","Overall, this is a good game. But, I bought a bunch of stuff on my iPhone, and logged into Facebook hoping to transfer my games data over to my Android phone, only it find out that none of it transfers across phones, but I can still log into Facebook. This is a little more than anoying, and if there's a way to fix the problem, this is an easy 5 star game.","I'll start by saying that a few days ago this would've been 4 starts as it's a fun game but the energy system slows it down. Today I got on and the game told me I hadn't beaten UWI yet? How? I have two WRBII robots and I was getting ready to fight Zues. So I though eh whatever I'll play through it really quick. So I equipped my old UWI robot and tried to go through the championship again. I beat UWI logged on the next day and the progress was gone once again. I still have all my robots and stuf","OK, all I can say is 'OUTSTANDING' with brilliant gameplay, astonishing graphics and gorgeous mechanics of the game itself. This one's better than the boxing champions I'm telling you. Gives me back many nostalgia! Playing since 2013 (it's first release) and I see there's alot changes now that really improved the game and impressed me, the mystery draw was a great thing coz you can win alot of unique robots like Zeus, Atom, Cosmobot and more! Good job reliance!","This game I'm played in 2016..all the stages completed..after I deleted the game..now in 2021.
