You buy the packs and so much of what you buy you never get. Fun game, but \"free play\" sadly isn't much fun as you can't compete and always lose everything when you can't afford shields.","This is a pay to win game. No matter how many free events there are you never going to get what is offered to people who pay. There are people with all over a billion power they will farm you. If you can't be on the game daily even free events aren't going to help. Plan to play for 3 years before you can compete and by then they will be even stronger. Maybe if you had just start up battlefields.","Tell you what, I watched the gameplay of this and I was sold! It looks like toystory meets call of duty!! I downloaded it instantly, looks great!!! Ill give It 5 stars until further notice. Remember, Xbox and Playstation controllers can connect to your android device, so you don't need the touch screen to play! Anymore :D","Well, I saw this game on an ad and I though \"Hey this looks interesting\" but when I actually installed it, it was NOTHING like the ad, it was one of those territory games, but the thing in the ad said that it was a Third Person shooter game like COD or Fortnite, but no it wasn't, talk about a rip-off. Anyways, it was a complete waste of time.","The game takes some time getting used to, however 9/10 times you're going to get attacked by someone three times stronger than you (most likely pays to win), so understanding how to get aegis and leveling up is paramount.

Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other.

In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature.

It can get slow sometimes if you aren't willing to pay to play. But you can watch a bunch of ads to get diamonds and energy some of the time. My biggest issue is how long it takes to open spirit jars. Some take 12 hours. It makes it hard to level up and get upgrades. If all your slots are full, you can't get new jars when you complete new missions. So you just have to wait or miss out.","I didn't rated 5 star because of the energy system, I need to watch ads before doing the task when I no have enough energy. Beside that, I think this game not have many functions, example:sit, eat, drink, jump and phone.Whatever,I played this game already one year,I think this game have a nice graphics👍 and a large map, a great effect .maybe this game can't even good than gta5,but I still think this is my most favorite open world mobile game.","The game is better than I thought. The game is nice and great especially the free roam part. I gave it only four stars because you can't put away ur weapon as far as I know, you can crouch, you can't jump bc there's no button for it and there's no way to be sneaky or stealthy bc once u shoot or kill a cop, they know where your location is even if they didn't see you. As far as I know, u can't change the radio either. I would still recommend and play this game tho.","Great game, beyond my expectations. It's graphics is simply awesome. And very addictive. Very missions are nail biting thrills will never take your eyes from it . Recommend to all , especially for action pack lovers instead of playing free fire and call of duty, play this extraordinary game. It's my honest review . Love this game very much.","The game is really interesting has really nice resolution for a mobile game and it is really fun but the only downfall is the story it's a bit shorter than expected and I personally think that you could do an expansion on the map Idk like adding 12 more turfs would be more interesting and fun you could also add that u can buy more island's but I have a grether idea 💡 but I don't know how would it preform it could be more than 12 GB just call it gangster USA my insta for info 1david.radivojevic1"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftOLHM","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftOLHM&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Among Us","description":"Play online or over local WiFi with 4-15 players as you attempt to prep your spaceship for departure, but beware as one will be an impostor bent on killing everyone!\r\n\r\nCrewmates can win by completing all tasks or discovering and voting the impostor off the ship. \r\n\r\nThe Impostor can use sabotage to cause chaos, making for easier kills and better alibis.","descriptionHTML":"Play online or over local WiFi with 4-15 players as you attempt to prep your spaceship for departure, but beware as one will be an impostor bent on killing everyone!<br><br>Crewmates can win by completing all tasks or discovering and voting the impostor off the ship. <br><br>The Impostor can use sabotage to cause chaos, making for easier kills and better alibis.","summary":"Join your crewmates in a multiplayer game of teamwork and betrayal!","installs":"100,000,000+","minInstalls":100000000,"maxInstalls":421354736,"score":3.5664537,"scoreText":"3.6","ratings":12300711,"reviews":6313601,"histogram":{"1":3192779,"2":669324,"3":867991,"4":1118560,"5":6452054},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$0.99 -

The update is quite complex. You can't log back into the game if you dont sign in if by any chance you have to reinstall the app. The chat is way different than it was and it basically is like they have completely took the chat away from us. Recently I have experienced that I can't get onto any servers even if I host a server myself. There is only one way I can get on. FIX THIS!!!!!!","I used to love love love this game. The new chat has ruined it.... And it's too bad! I also get disconnected from the server EVERY game. I haven't been able to finish a game in I don't know how long because I get disconnected. So annoying :( Talking about the chat it is just terrible... It takes too much time to navigate though the option and it isn't intuitive at all. An essential part of among us was the chat! Bring it back!!!!","I really love this game. The two stars are because: there are added colors and more players. The others was because of that update. Yes, I know that everyone is talking about it. The chat update. It's really terrible. You can't say what you want. Why don't you just cover some letters on the bad words, though? And because of that, I took away my three stars. Please remove the terrible updates that we hate. If you do, we will bring back some stars. But, please don't add more/keep terrible updates.","It used to be a really fun game to play with your friends. A classic murder mystery with a unique art style. However the creators ruined the game by adding in the auto chat. Now no one will take what you say seriously because it is now impossible to explain yourself. I feel like removing auto chat or making it optional would fix all the problems that the creators have now made for themselves. It's disappointing that I can't play it with my friends because the developers ruined it completely.","I used to love this game since 2018. The new game update (Quick Chat) is now permanent and there is nothing more annoying than that. The social element is gone as the new chat functions are just so robotic. We can't debate and investigate the real imposter, which used to the real thrill and fun from this game. The update just removed the very essence that makes this game so enjoyable in the past. Give us adults an option to use free chat. Don't restrict us players so much."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.innersloth.spacemafia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innersloth.spacemafia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google","description":"The Google app keeps you in the know about things that matter to you.

Best part is that you dont have to upgrade your bot really to beat the boss, maybe just one or two. Also, no need to really purchase anything, just do good combos. The only bad thing is that you have to get google play so if you delete it you dont have any progress, make sure you save the progress!! To help you if you have trouble winning, purchase these robots: UWI Ambush UWII Six Shooter WRB I Gridlock WRB Albino WRB- Metro Gold","Overall, this is a good game. But, I bought a bunch of stuff on my iPhone, and logged into Facebook hoping to transfer my games data over to my Android phone, only it find out that none of it transfers across phones, but I can still log into Facebook. This is a little more than anoying, and if there's a way to fix the problem, this is an easy 5 star game.","I'll start by saying that a few days ago this would've been 4 starts as it's a fun game but the energy system slows it down. Today I got on and the game told me I hadn't beaten UWI yet? How? I have two WRBII robots and I was getting ready to fight Zues. So I though eh whatever I'll play through it really quick. So I equipped my old UWI robot and tried to go through the championship again. I beat UWI logged on the next day and the progress was gone once again. I still have all my robots and stuf","OK, all I can say is 'OUTSTANDING' with brilliant gameplay, astonishing graphics and gorgeous mechanics of the game itself. This one's better than the boxing champions I'm telling you. Gives me back many nostalgia! Playing since 2013 (it's first release) and I see there's alot changes now that really improved the game and impressed me, the mystery draw was a great thing coz you can win alot of unique robots like Zeus, Atom, Cosmobot and more! Good job reliance!","This game I'm played in 2016..all the stages completed..after I deleted the game..now in 2021. Again I downloaded and started playing..but I don't know there is a small problem I'm facing..3rd of August 21 massage I can see device blocked...why I can't understand...my all the ability cards and transform cards gone...what is this new problem??"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jumpgames.rswrb","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jumpgames.rswrb&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"DC Legends: Fight Superheroes","description":"Recruit Justice League Legends like Batman, Superman, The Flash, Wonder Woman, The Joker, Harley Quinn and many more in the ultimate DC superhero fighting game!\r\n\r\nAs the shadow of the Blackest Night prophecy falls on every world, sheer willpower alone cannot save the shattered DC Universe.

The different game modes are awesome, and the reward system is generous. The Hero/Villain Roster is amazing! I was playing SW:GOH, for years and the developers ended up ruining the game over the years. They focused more on making money rather than keeping it fun. The rewards became very slim. But, if this games stays the way it is with great reward drops, and fairly priced in-game purchases, I'll play this game everyday, and I'll gladly recommend it to everyone I can.","Amazing game. Is not a money grab like the avengers game. It be cool if they can bring some new cools updates. Such as Allowing to invite random people to an alliance. Able to join a random alliance. Heroic mode cost a lot of energy so there a limit of how much you can play. Overall is an amazing game. But the game might need more funding and cool features to get more players Still derseve 5 starts","Been playing for 4 years or more daily (absolutely love it). Best mobile game to date. Very in depth rpg system. Every battle can be different with tons of different play styles. We'll over a 100 characters maybe even nearing 200 now. You can play this game daily for 10 minutes or a few hours to get daily challenges it's all up to you. Or you can play in few minute increments if your a busy worker. Not pay to win, paying only helps you boost a little faster but not necessary. Favorite game!","Great game, especially for beginners, but the grind is made too long and most characters become useful only after certain Legendary Skills have been unlocked, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money very early on you won't have these abilities that make most characters good, also energy goes way too fast, and instead of having a node be playable without recharging it 3 times make it 5, a too hardcore grind right off the bat will make some players quit the game","I've been playing faithfully for three years, got all the characters, was really strong, then they go and add one character (Black Flash) that makes it where you can't do anything and die every single time. It was great until they added that character. TONE DOWN BLACK FLASH SO WE CAN DO PLAY INSTEAD OF ALL CHARACTERS BEING DEFEATED BEFORE WE CAN EVEN DO ONE ATTACK!!!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.wb.goog.dc.legends","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.dc.legends&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google News - Top world & local news headlines","description":"Google News is a personalized news aggregator that organizes and highlights what’s happening in the world so you can discover more about the stories that matter to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nStay up to date on your interests\r\n\r\n• The For You tab delivers the top stories across all your favorite topics and sources in one place.

Google, please fix this app so that it doesn't do that, or at least somehow allow me to return to the story that I was in the middle of reading, since it's probably no longer in the updated feed.","While the app is good for what it does, the AMP implementation is really frustrating. AMP really needs to be nuked in this day and age, as phones don't need stripped down versions of websites. AMP really does break a lot of news sites and functionality. There also isn't any syncing across desktop and mobile versions. Still needs work to function properly.","This is a great app for getting notifications from different sources. However the customisation needs some work. I continue to get notifications from news sources I have specifically blocked. Also the 'see fewer articles like this' option seems to have disappeared. I just received a headline on a particular subject from a specific news source. I wanted to block the source but not the subject. When I clicked 'turn off', it turned off the subject, not the source.","There is a bug where clicking on the article from the android home screen makes the link disappear. So additional clicks on the article does nothing. This bug has been around for at least 3 years. Every morning I wake up hoping that an update fixes it, every morning I am disappointed.","This apps can cause my phone to reset and go into hang state. I have to do manual reset to recover. For now, I've to do a manual cache clear everytime before I run the apps. Today, this apps caused a reset of my phone again. Looks like manual cache clear is also not working.

It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!!

This tool will surface photos or videos you might want to delete — like blurry photos, screenshots and large videos.","comments":["Not uploading photos unless my app is open. (The option to load photos automatically is ticked) I've recommended this app to so many people, simply because when you used take a photo, it used upload automatically, and You Used never lose any photos. Now they are charging you for the app, and no matter what i tick (upload over mobile data ect which is always ticked) it won't upload. I have to keep the app open, and even at that it still won't upload, doesn't upload if my phone goes to sleep.","Latest update seems to of stopped auto backups. Google photos used to backup everything in the background and work perfectly. Now it shows all media that could be backed up and you have to go in and select everything. It then seems to take ages to update. I'm not sure if this is as others have said because you need to have the app open. Hopefully a new version will be available soon. Previous given 5 stars and recommend the app to friends and family. However not at the moment.","If I could give this app 0 stars, I would. Ever since Google decided to limit their storage on this app it has become extremely laggy and photos are not backing up like they're suppose to. I'm thinking about looking for an alternative photo cloud that provides better service. I'm extremely disappointed with Google.","8/7/21 -some pix still won't move to sd card & I have downloaded to phone first. 8/7/21 Now, overnight, some Google pix have rearranged themselves w/wrong heading dates. Dates are correct once you go into the info of the pictures & some groups of pix have split into different days! Still rate app a 1. 8/6/21 Some pix move to sd card, some won't. Spend hours getting a couple of pix moved. Google photos wants you to ONLY use their cloud!!","It is an amazing app for backing up your photos really easily. I take alot of photos and quite alot of them in 48 megapixels so they have rather big file sizes. I appreciate the full quality backup but sometimes I doubt if they are full quality but overall they are very good quality. I really like the layout of the app and it works well with lots of apps, it is also very easy to quiqly download photos. It would be good if you could use Google photos do compress photo file sizes."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.photos","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Gangstar Vegas: World of Crime","description":"Gangstar Vegas is a role-playing game to become the leader of a gang in Las Vegas, while playing along gangsters and mafia cartels, in a free open game world with gang wars.\r\n\r\nV IS FOR LAS VEGAS: THE CITY OF SIN\r\nExplore this open city with different TPS missions, box the mafia cartel, fight for the final prize and play in different adventure crime clans vs. the gang world of the city of Las Vegas.\r\nThis is an RPG adventure saga of mafia and waging gang wars.

It has minor issues of real time. Street view doesn't always work, even after I previously did a street view of that location. This app would be perfect if I could program my own route. I'm an escort (Pilot car) for oversize loads. We have routes issued to us by the states and counties. Plus, sometimes I don't like the route, google maps offers. One last thing, I wish we could switch to satellite view AFTER we hit \"start\". Thank you!","For quite a while I couldn't get voiced notifications. So, I decided to \"Google\" it. It said, delete cache and data. It seemed to work fine. I have just done an 8.5 hour journey that should have taken 5.5 hours. No fault of Google obviously. However, 3/4 of the way through the trip, the notifications stopped. Then 30 minutes before our journey end the voiced notifications packed up. If this does not alter I'll try 'Waze', it looks a much better option.","Never uses the most direct or fastest route. I entered my destination and it said it would take 1 hour and 40 minutes on the fastest of the 3 options of routes it gave me, which I knew was way off. I used another navigation app and reached my destination in 50 minutes. Other times it has taken me off the beaten path in an unfamiliar city and through some very bad neighborhoods when I could have stayed on the interstate and reached my destination much, much faster and safer. Do not recommend.","This application is always inaccurate with time tracking. It also makes serious errors which make the driver lost. It also makes it hard to see future directions. When it does a good job it is excellent but when it doesn't it is highly frustrating. The app made a mistake and said Jefferson hwy was Jefferson heights and kept sending me to the wrong location. It also gets lost in the French quarter. It is frustrating and can cause loss of employment and lost time in one's life.","Maps has not been working properly for me for the past month! It won't load the map and when getting directions, it wants me to take the longest, most ridiculous route to get to my destination. It also loses signal often and gets lost, or will tell me to turn at the very last minute causing me to miss turns. Please make an update for this app to correct itself!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.maps","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Play Books & Audiobooks","description":"Google Play Books is the one app you need for enjoying audiobooks and ebooks purchased from Google Play.\r\n\r\nChoose from millions of best selling ebooks, comics, textbooks, and audiobooks.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much!

With a new set of songs each Wednesday, there is always more to explore. ","comments":["This is the first (and only) music app I have ever used. And my GOD what a choice of songs. YouTube Music must have every song 🎵 in the world!! And eventually if you hit the like button often enough they will create a list of just your favorite songs/videos. I pay for YouTube premium and I'm sure that's why I don't get any ads at all. I'm very 😊 happy with YouTube Music so far.","This app is alright. I have premium, so I can't comment of the ads. The functions for listening to songs are quite good. However, ocationaly on songs it will say they are from a different artist, or play a song to what it says and what the album cover is. For example, when I went into thefatrat's \"Rise up\" it played a song called solitude instead. This was later fixed, however, if I go to the song, \"Kings and Queens Part two\" by Ava Max, it will sometimes play the wrong song.","The radio option is the only thing I really don't like about it. When you selected \"radio\" on an artist in Google play music it played songs that were from similar artists. YTM however, seems to play songs from artists that you've listened to a lot. Example: Hit the radio button on a power metal artist and the radio starts playing a bunch of TOOL because I've listened to them a lot and it really doesn't fit at all, especially when I'm using it to explore other artists in the power metal genre.","Not fit for purpose. I've been trying to work with this junk since launch. Spent months creating 12 playlists across 12 genres, totalling 9,170 tracks to listen to my playlists across my 7 Google hub max speakers. However, regardless of what playlist you select, even on shuffle, it will always start off playing the first track. It will then continue to play the same 20 or 30 tracks over and over again all day long even when playlist has over 1000 tracks. Switched to Spotify yesterday, heaven!!","I enjoy using the app. It creates several Mixes for you from different genres & eras that you listen to so you can choose what you're in the mood for. Every Wednesday there's a Discover Mix which I love. It's a mix of music they think you'll like based on your music choices. I'd give it 5 stars, but they took away the tab that used to drop down with your task bar. That was great bc you could skip through songs without leaving the app you're currently in.

I love the concept of being able to customize I've played this game for years and I've been on and off with it. I had the game downloaded about two years ago and had no problems. But now in 2021 whenever I try to play the game freezes and I cant do anything except the info button and once I restart it, it says my profile has been banned for unauthorized activity even tho I havent played the game in years. Plz help😐","It's a good game, the reason why I'm giving this a 3-star is because I have a lot of problem since I was playing this game, sometimes when I fight the enemies once I drop their hp to 0, they still stay alive, and my other problem is it's hard to get rewards, I would suggest increasing the drop rate after winning the game, my third problem is the energy cores, it takes too long to recharge them back again, that's all.","Good game all around and though I do prefer the original version for sure this is quite the upgrade in terms of origins for the bot, also while I do find some of the items can be extremely expensive there are often ways to counteract this such as with the upgrading parts to silver gold etc: the solution I found was to do sparring matches on pro every time I got 5 energy cores until I had enough cash. This is still an amazing game, thanks alot","Really enjoyed playing this game... Loved the ability to make your own robot from a wide range of parts, moves and designs.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

I used to have a different colour for grandchildren, one for the dogs, red for all doctors or dentists appointments and purple for all the birthdays. Now any that are set stay that colour but all new ones are blue. I can't see at a glance what I'm doing now. It's sooo disappointing. I'm going to have to look for a different one to help me remember everything.","One important feature has been ignored and it should be included. For example, if you want to check the calender for 1975 or a specific date in 1975, you have to scroll through each month from present date till you get to 1975, and this is cumbersome. The user should be able to JUMP TO A DATE FORWARD OR BACKWARD without having to scroll through for a long time.","All of a sudden it crashes whenever I open it, and I haven't updated anything, so they must have pushed a Google services update to break it. Clearing cache, rebooting, uninstalling updates didn't help. So I update to latest version to see if it helps, and it won't read local calendar. And no I'm not syncing so Google can spy on me more. Luckily I have titanium backup to get to old version, although it will no doubt still be unusable.","Wish I could provide a higher score but I need to stop using Google Calendar. The calendar widget no longer displays in Light Theme while the system is in Night Mode. This despite the Calendar app itself displaying in Light Theme quite happily while the system is in Night Mode. The widget displaying like this has become unusable so I need to find a replacement app. Good times, Google Calendar. Good times. If only the widget respected the settings of the Calendar app itself, I'd be able to keep using you. Too bad because the app itself has been quite useful.","Great App but won't let me remove default samsung calendar. I just got a new phone and all of a sudden a samsung calendar popped up and my calendar also synced to Google and now I can't delete them. It's driving me nuts. All I want is the original calendar I set up and to delete the ones I don't use, but you can only delete them on the computer and they do not show up there."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.calendar","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Plenty of Fish Free Dating App","description":"The Best Online Dating Experience - Singles have more conversations on Plenty of Fish (POF) than any other dating app!\r\n\r\nPOF is designed to help singles find happy relationships!

It use to be cool. Set up 2as simple. Now it has so many catfish profiles. It freezes. When you reply to a message it doesn't show you replied so you have to get out of the message and go back in to see it. Constantly having to refresh. The swipe option like tinder is dumb now. The whole front and set up is complicated. And for fawk sake, it won't let you delete your profile on the app. Make you type in a link and the link doesn't work. I'm so irritated","Can't get the video chat to work. I was somehow charged $40 for trying to sign up, then $15 for the same thing. Still can't get it to work. I'm a premium member so I thought it was free, but as usual nothing is free. I've even got some nice woman trying to help me out and it just doesn't work! Hit the phone icon and it says call canceled.... This is a joke","Awful. My premium account stopped working. I can't send messages. Support is terrible. They keep sending pre-written article saying it'll resolve in 24 hours. It's been 72 hours still not working. The phone support, make you wait for awhile and then give you only one option which is to record a voicemail. Support is a joke. Besides account and support issues, the app has too many bots and catfish. Don't waste your money on it.","Not great. Way too many fake profiles!! Unlike Tinder no way to see the genuine ones. The matches they make for you are miles away from your location, so no point setting a search radius as they ignore that anyway. Has showed on several occasions that I've liked someone when I know dam well I haven't. So all in all pretty poor, but no better or worse than any others I guess!!","The worst app ever for registration. No matter what I do, I can't register. Probably the worst programmers ever. No other app does these issues when registering. It always send no match between email and password, even when there is a 100% match. I wastem more than an hour trying to register. I would make it within several seconds using other apps. My recommendation: Find other more serious apps that function and that don't have technical issues. Don't waste your time on app!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.pof.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pof.android&hl=en&gl=us"}]
