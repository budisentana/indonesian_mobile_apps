Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles. Will update my feedback as I continue using it"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.mapswithme.maps.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Talking Ginger 2","description":"Ginger's Birthday - It’s time for some birthday fun!\r\n\r\nTalking Ginger, the cutest little kitten, is growing up and wants you to celebrate his birthday with him. :-)\r\n\r\nJoin him for the best party ever - with awesome food and loads of games!

If you're smart you can play without spending too much but it's pretty impossible to enjoy the game without spending anything. If you want to stay above water expect to spend a couple thousand over a period of 2 years and thats just keeping your head above water. The biggest players spend over $1000 per week.

Used to play it when it was only on IOS sometime before 2014 I believe. Enjoy the game for a year and then it becomes a waste of time if you don't have money to spend. I have 3rd world money during covid season. I think they're the same guys doing \"The Ants\" game.

The pictures are NOT EVEN like the game play. I have been playing for 2 years now, and the drudgery is all over. Players have $$$$$$$$ will succeed the most, and heros? Good luck, I haven't had one for 1 1/2 years, all duplicates, same, same, same. I don't play in eden, nor clash. I am lucky, my clan doesn't mind me, I help where I can. It would be nice if the attacks were lvl base, a 25 wipes out a lvl5.

I mean odds of getting the battle Mech is 1%! and I have to pay $10 4 the chance to get it! That's redicoulis! I should b able to just buy the decor pack that I like. And once u reach base level 20, it costs $100 to open the VIP store!! That's outrageous! I really enjoy the game & understand that u have to make $ to create the game. But some changes should b made.","Fun game, build a city, attack zombies, meet people from all over the world, join alliances. Conquer the state. And after that, start a state war. What more can you ask for. The only thing I would improve on is a better sound track for the game. I love this game. The translator is a great. My suggestion to some players is to build multiple accounts as a farm.","This game is good in all its aspects like base building, social interaction and long term interest. But the thing which killed it is the people with money becomes so much powerful that a normal person can't compete with him in 100 years even if he plays without money. You can be great at this game only if spend 1000s of dollars. Really a shameful tactics by developer. Please tell me one powerful player in any alliance who has not spent 1000s of dollars. Then ask me to join a aliiance.","This game will get boring after some time. Also most disappointed things about this game there are no value of your skill, intelligence, IQ, strategy , luck, good timing etc. When you enter the game you can never beat your opponents if they are more powerful than you at the time. Only army power is important here. Only who can spends money they can achieve quick growth and there are very expensive packeges.

It's easy to play and it doesn't really matter if you never get good at it. Challenges never really become too hard. Many are complaining about the ads but this game, in my opinion, has a very tolerable (and rewarding) ad scheme compared to other games out there. It's also amazing how the devs are still supporting this game. EDIT: I think it's better if the Potion count increased past 197, this gives more incentive to grind after maxing out.","Hello. I really wanted to write a review because this is fun. Because when my tablet is lagging, the zombies were just walking and there are no open roads. Ads is also popping up when the game has ended. Really fun game. I just hope that the mission is easier for children like me, and my little sister really hates that when the brains are collected starting to 11 or 12 it gets faster or gets more challenging. But for me, this game is challenging, really funny, entertaining and too many ads","Everything else is great; gameplay, graphics, controls. Ads aren't annoying in this game compared to others. I reduced it to one star is the fact I can't connect it with my Google Play account. I guess it is much better in saving progress than logging in with Facebook and I didn't used and logged in to my FB account IN YEARS. or atleast gave us [non-FB users] an option to save our progress through our Google Play account. Until then, I can give this review a worthy five stars. Thank you!","Great game! Super fun with amazing gameplay and cartoony graphics! I would give five stars but there is one thing that bothers me, when I try to watch ads to get five diamonds, it shows the ad, then doesn't give me any diamonds, or sometimes even takes some away! When this is fixed I will definitely give 5 stars! Awesome game nonetheless!","Hello Developers, the game is awesome already since 2013 and i play this game long time ago since my tablet is still working the features is Great Graphics, Easy Control, Great for low age like me, and of course its funny and challenging this game is old but Gold."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"net.mobigame.zombietsunami","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mobigame.zombietsunami&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Radarbot: Radar alerts, maps, traffic & GPS","description":"The only app that combines real-time alerts with the best offline radar detection alert system.

First off, this is a really great app but i hate the new update. Like you have to restart your quest all over again, I took so long to complete those and now i have to do it again. Next, I just hate it how you need to do the most of the work when your killing bosses or ect. or else you barely get any coins or exp. Its just so annoying I barely lvl up anymore. Anyways I hope you see this and fix it.","Graphics are great, and it can be played offline. Downside is that it's not easy to get enough elixers needed to level up. Update: the update was stupid. They changed the way you fight (ruined, actually). There's a chance of missing when you attack, and there's an added 'critical' attack from your enemy that almost kills you. I really regret getting the update. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. 💔","This game is amazing!! I have been playing since it was released in 2018. This has by far always been my favorite game since I figured out it existed. It's just my style, and I love animals!! There is a membership pass (not necasserily pay to win) and you can gain access to special items, and it makes the game easier!! There's also very many game modes: Team Fight, (Team PvP) Solo PvP, Battle Arena, Den Party, and regular leveling servers. It's a great game, great graphics, everything is lovely.","Hi there again.! This is an amazing game and I've been playing it for about.. two years, I think! The new updates are amazing and I love the models! But there's only one thing that had bothered me,, I'm sure you may have read the same thing in other replies, but I've started all the way back on Wild Plains on my Quests with this new update for some reason, I used to be on Japanese Forest Quests. I really hope you have time to fix that..! Thank you if you've read this, again. Keep it up! ^^","I love this game! The graphics are good, and you can play with friends which is great! I actually have a few suggestions for animals! 1 . Giraffe ( My most preferred ) 2 . Monkey, and or Gorilla 3 . Snake 4 . Rhino 5 . (A bit extreme) Some fantasy creatures like : Dragon, Wendigo, Griffin, Better looking Unicorn, and Pegacorn/Alicorn ( And maybe a new accessory that looks like all the animals have wings? )"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.turborocketgames.wildcraft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.turborocketgames.wildcraft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Crowd City","description":"Become the biggest crowd in town!\r\nGather people accross the city and crush your opponents with your overwhelming leadership!","descriptionHTML":"Become the biggest crowd in town!<br>Gather people accross the city and crush your opponents with your overwhelming leadership!","summary":"The real crowd experience!","installs":"100,000,000+","minInstalls":100000000,"maxInstalls":169785742,"score":4.0355935,"scoreText":"4.0","ratings":138464,"reviews":66543,"histogram":{"1":19663,"2":5936,"3":9816,"4":17438,"5":85608},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$0.99 - $3.99 per item","size":"84M","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4 and up","developer":"VOODOO","developerId":"VOODOO","developerEmail":"support@voodoo.io","developerWebsite":"https://www.voodoo.io","developerAddress":"4 rue Jules Lefebvre, 75009 Paris","privacyPolicy":"https://www.voodoo.io/privacy","developerInternalID":"8306041507631589049","genre":"Arcade","genreId":"GAME_ARCADE","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HvcVIhfvIqWsobFVDbz6sxgh0sNXVYKGwjvq5uGiDaCyPi7hOSjqvQaWQbs793HvTyEf","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/16TZlIlZBl0quEtGN0NAxBeel-YkZTV-oof9oVpB_mZXYaUBo2QRXGDzEJpSpMbxEQ88","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0XnP3hPTdl_nvMiJ2re-VKuIx5rHaDrOu_vkIVkG1oicyZmf6QnrlaywRyP2hKXhTGnZ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/g3AQH-kEJhivY0GCiDFeYEFW0NUrJtKP1Cz5LSeFndrsmvGipano-riutx1Ia6a5QQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qyB9upno49I1w5lcCxO0CQsvL_Qz_gfza8mImltpSHd0vSFbSkLxySh-BODanS9X1Ev5","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6-eU7wCJn7PumG2CSNEINxRMjhW46E_cjHN3hxSpVFsncVEdfAe65cEYXwqVco6RskUh","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IQdqYtLPBBT584ETFYFrwNHozyckPXRPGzhOY40--UUhsIy5D28zJ6-7qspl_ie32dE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1K87Oee3L2FaA7xwNmuEqqgfOWzXcTi67mJ2DqBVDHCz884rou0edBlpMdJogHVrxu0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fylEeHdEuGCY_ZYQxzOFZ1787wRjsM-1jo3Yhpp7G6Y34jfjKNEZCjkSVVsMEjB_MHw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GIvhN9Tr6_QULulMt_MNxuGLR_0yWhEfoII3U9ltQkMVQP7chtWUap7KFvBStc85eIQ"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Feb 19, 2019","updated":1627056507000,"version":"1.8.0","recentChanges":"Minor bug fixes.","comments":["I love this game, it's very fun to play.

Thought maybe it would get more difficult as the levels progressed. Nope! The boss levels are all the same and all the levels are really easy. It would be more fun if 1. You had to destroy the robots, not just knock them off the edge. 2. The robots moved faster. 3. The robots were more challenging to kill. I mean, they must all be made of air or something because one hit and they go flying. 4. The levels get harder as you progress.","This game is good when I played it a few years back but now it's just a peace of junk. The game doesnt even work so if its my problem or the games pls fix it but it's still cool tho. Like really cool ☺😆😀.

I'm aiming at the robot head and it's shooting at the 'girl' - REALLY!!! REALLY!!! Pshaw! PSHAW!!!","This game is fun but after a while it just gets boring. I mean I have like 15 hours on it but there's never anything new, all the devs do is change the icon every once in a while. What I'd like to see is More enemy's Events or new areas New weapons like mele weapons Character customization or weapon customization Or even rewards for getting to a certain level Thats all I'm asking for but I doubt they'll listen or even see the review but please work on the game.","So far I'm really liking this game makes you think fast whether you're super accurate or semi-accurate you still make a steady progression as far as moving through the obstacles and the better you get the faster you pass each level and it's exciting to see the robots coming after you as you blast them away"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ohmgames.knockdolls","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ohmgames.knockdolls&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Talking Tom Jetski 2","description":"Get ready to race jetskis with Talking Tom and Friends!

Graphics and detail of cars is my favorite part of the game, and game play drives you to Want to collect more cars and progress. I'm F2P, and the in-game purchase prices are ridiculous IMO, but it's still my favorite game. Been playing for 10 months now, and I can't see myself leaving this game any time soon. Only complaints are the modders who tend to ruin the live racing and some of the bugs, but with each update, it seems to be improving. Get rid of modders and it's 5 stars","Legit I WISH this game was not a pay-to-win. Such Great game play, though repetitive. Graphics are phenomenal. However the biggest con is the pay wall. Play as long as you want to, but there isn't anything you can put up against other players who can pay for everything and anything. I want to give this game 5 stars. But I can't when I am handicapped that much, so much potential to be even better. But the constant bombardment of paying to get extra stuff to give you an edge is FAR too much.","Fun game to play. Support was questionable at first because I lost an account and it took a better part of a week to get it back, but the end result was they were able to retrieve the account. As for the game. As a car racing game the graphics and options are unmatched. This game will allow you to lose yourself so you can obtain the next measurable goal you want to achieve. Happy playing, this game has a 5th anniversary for a reason!","Started playing a few days ago and had managed to get upgraded enough to unlock the nitrous tuning. After entering the tuning mode for the nitrous, I can't seem to get the game to leave the screen! There's no 'Back' button, no way for me to switch to a different screen... The only way I can play is by avoiding hitting the upgrade button from the main screen. Please help? Edit: I was too dumb to pay attention to the on-screen \"Poke Here!\" symbol... 🤦🏻‍♂️","This nor the original CSR work on my Google Pixel 3 XL. At first CSR2 worked fine, managed to beat a couple of races, then when I tried accessing it again it would load the first two screens then it just goes blank. All I could hear is the music. I've tried uninstalling them and they do the same dang thing. I was really excited to play this once again after many years of not playing it. But it is a bummer that this is happening."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.naturalmotion.customstreetracer2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naturalmotion.customstreetracer2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Radio FM","description":"Radio FM\r\nRadio FM (Radio for Mobile) is an app to play Internet Radio stations.

Every time I used the app, I'd get 5 minutes of music and 30 minutes of spin (nothing). Didn't matter how strong my signal was, it wouldn't play. All settings on my phone was correct. This wasn't another app seizing the speaker. The damn thing just wouldn't play. I don't need that type of aggravation. There, app owner, does that satisfy your demand?","This app had a terrible feature where you had to listen to a 40+ second ad every single time you hit play on a station. This made it incredibly awful to use. The app has since been updated and removed this flaw. Returned to being an outstanding app, and I really appreciate them listening to customers! EDIT: And we're back to one star again. App developer brought back the advertisement you must listen to EVERY time you connect to a station. Awful feature.","I don't usually listen to the radio, however since I found and picked this App out, it has yet to let me down. As far as i can see, their is a varity of music and channels to pick from. I have yet to explore everything but 4 me this is perfect! Hope this App serves you well.

The game needs more development like we need long roads like highways and different cities to you can travel also new cars are needed, car shouldn't have equal speeds and take of rather. It will also be better if there are pedestrians and also have missions...","The game is great. I am amazed how I can interact with most of the car elements like sunroof , convertible . But day night should occur in the form of an alternate cycle. Add realistic weather too . Also add npc cars and pedestrians . Add more cars . Add , folding side mirrors, ac , seat belt , aerospoiler , DRLs in cars . Blinkers on side mirrors. Enlarge the map . Add airport. The map is kinda small .","Game is alright but you have to add one thing when we playing a game we are take the types of vehicles and we park the vehicles at the different House and when we go to main menu and again start the game we go to these houses but we can't find our vehicles Please do these that when we leave from the game we find our vehicles in our house in your next update Thanks.","Ok this is a great game,but there is no place for drifting, they need to add more cistomizations to the car and you can enter places and also add traffic also the map needs to be expand because i barely hit 3 gear when driving and the turning is kinda bad, and that makes the game boring because you can only drive you cant really drive speed enough plus drift amd hardly go in places also when i add turbo the car is still kinda slow as thats what i experience its really great game","I love the game but u should add a inclosed car trailer that can hold more than one car and add on the next update that u can have 4 or 5 cars also put damage on for the cars so when u crash some body parts will fall off it would be super cool and maybe make the map bigger but all in all the game is awesome..."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sebby.rebaixadoselitebrasil","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sebby.rebaixadoselitebrasil&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Beach Buggy Blitz","description":"Drive your hot-rod beach buggy as far as you can into the uncharted depths of a mysterious tropical island!\r\n\r\nSwerve and smash through a gorgeously detailed and completely destructible world packed with Tiki statues, grass shacks, giant crabs, lava monsters...even yetis!

True! Sticking with it. Ads should be no longer than 10 seconds or they've lost their audience. ***** Added much later date. The ads are more than annoying. Like I said - no more than 15 seconds. You should tell your advertisers that....especially in the middle of the night. You wake up; want to play a bit -- but have to watch these obnoxious ads first. Unless you move on to another game. Bottom line- I'm gonna delete it as soon as I finish this.","Bubble I am hooked although there are times when there is no way to win. No I am not being a sore loser just frustrated. After I reached 3009 I believe where I am now there is no way to win. When I get close they pop up the colors with no where to go. But I keep trying but not sure how long. Then they drop me a level but still no change in that level","Fun!! LOVE IT!!! The 1 thing that pisses me off about this game is I'll need 1 bubble and I watch the video and it just circles and circles. I have to close out game, start all over! Lose my points, rewards etc. PLUS THE EXTRA THAT I HAVE PAID FOR!!! FIX THE GLITCH ALREADY!!!","I enjoy playing this game to pass the time but I'm over all the ads. I get that it helps make the game free but I swear they are the most annoying ads. I get ads for games where the first sound u hear is someone yelling. There are several just like that. I think it's time for a different game.","I am deleting this after many years of playing it!!!!!!!! I am at level 3,9?? Most levels of coarse are hard but now so hard that a person would have to spend MONEY & Plenty to pass levels!!!!!!!!! I don't have that money to spare on unrewarding, pretty much, games!!!!!!!!!!!

To improve the game try doing these: 1)remove ads because pop up ads are horrible 2)only use ads for buying items and stuff 3) try adding more animation for masha because no kid would like seeing a masha staring at them with a big grin and swinging her hands, it terrifies me.","I rlly like this game.

Thank u for making this game . ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️","It is a very bad app because if l do not turn on my mobile's internet then also ads come and when l want to close the app it does not close","20 seconds of game 30 seconds of adverts... repeat \"Thank you for your comment.
