How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home. So, instead of just opening the tracker in another browser tab, the developers in their infinite wisdom have decided that it is better if you unlock your phone, open the app, and then be able to locate.

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going. They need to fix that but is something I could live with it. Using Google pixel 5","Really annoying, possibly due to bugs. The interface was mostly fine. However, I was playing my Spotify via Bluetooth while navigating with Google Maps. I dropped my friends off about a half a block away from the original destination so I no longer needed that destination, yet the interface wouldn't let me enter a new location and the search icon was unresponsive. I didn't want to disconnect my Bluetooth to reset the app since it'd disconnect my music, so I ended up doing my own navigating.","Connection is finicky. And it's not always intuitive which apps or features can be controlled from the device/phone or the car panel.

It will do the job but make you hate yourself for it. The interface is very heavy feeling and at times a pain to navigate. Its like trying to take a detour with no signs. They have catagories... sorta, but I am convinced it was just a program vomiting content after a night of cheap liquor. It has the vibe of a designed team that remember their assignment 3 hours before the deadline. Bring a GPS you're going to need it to find your way around.","More adds than video content. Often the videos fail, but don't worry the advertisements never do. If you try to rewatch a 10 second clip that recently failed, you'll have to watch the advertisement again, which never fails to run. Unacceptable for a company as large as it is, and owned by Disney. Get it together boys and girls....You should be better than this. I pay a monthly subscription for this, rediculous!","Incredibly terrible app for this size company. Load times are awful, there are 30 second unskippable commercials that freeze, so you wait 2 minutes to watch 25 seconds of content followed by more commercials. The watch app is terrible, I have espn+ membership but I'm unable to watch games that are on broadcast television like ABC, because I don't have a cable membership. Their watch section is laid out terribly and it's vague what you are able to watch with your membership. So bad.","If it weren't a dang monopoly, I would've deleted this app years ago. Slow load times, has no problem loading 40 second ads, but then won't load the 10 second highlight you came to see. But wait, try to find the highlight anywhere else, and it'll kick you back to their app. Please, for the love of God, can yahoo, or fox sports, or literally anyone make a half decent app for sports. I'll take it over this dumpster fire any day","Horrible lag in the app. Also it does a horrendous job playing videos. The big issue is the handoff from ad to content. And even when the video is playing, of you change the time on the video, it won't respond and will skip the video. Would have expected a lot more from a big company, bit the app has bee.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Find My Phone","description":"Find My Phone!\r\n\r\n\r\nFind My iPhone & Android Phone is the essential tracking tool for anyone who has experienced the stress, worry, and inconvenience associated with a lost or stolen device.

No skills involved, it only matters what you buy. Period. Fishing is only tapping on an icon. Lmao. Just remove the whole game part (which is ridiculously boring). Make it a \"who pays us, wins. Who doesn't, loses\". It'd be more honest.","Well you'll need money for starters,I've played for 4 years now and spent loads. Also the game isn't fair. You have challenges, generally every hour, you'd think you would be challenging people at the same level but no, there can be 60 plus level difference, that can take a couple of years to do, which means they have upgraded their fish to higher levels than you have,so impossible to win or challenge. Oh then there is the issue of NO CUSTOMER SERVICE NO HELP THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY with one finger","The game is pretty fun and realistic. With that being said the instructions could be better explained and the different aspects of game play because im still not sure im doing it right and ive been playing for awhile. Also it seems like in order to get any good perks or anything you have to buy stuff, i know yall have to make the monies but i would like a choice or not and still be able to get somewhere in the game.","Love this fishing game by far one of the best and reminds me of the one that you used to play back in the day on PlayStation! Literally brings back memories, oh and you can go fishing and all your favorite islands and beaches. It's like going on a little virtual vacation and going fishing right at the touch of your hands.. the only thing I would change is how long it takes you to upgrade and get your licenses! It also glitches out and you repeatedly catch the same fish over an over please fix!!","Fraudulant company. Very unfair game. Pay to play nothing free about it. Designed to let the high level players get even higher while destroying the game for general players. The support help is a joke and depends on how much you have spent to how much they will help you .

I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it.

I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful.

Don't need to spend if you know how to use the pop out ads to accumulate free grabs. Doesn't bore on scenery and accessories, but could use a more realistic prize display lineup, maybe a elimination mode and multiplayer mode. Also add some music and some interactive elements please! Great game regardless of the these minor flaws but I'll grab my claws now!!!!!!","This game is exciting and engaging for those who love claw games.In real claw machines,it is very difficult and rare to get a prize.However,the game developers make the game easier for players to collect prizes and even trade for more fun prizes.Lastly,thank you for making this game offline so that I can play it anytime!Keep up the good work!","A bit janky but it's a great time passer. A few issues, like too many coins built up I wish they had a rest on the prizes, also how am I supposed to do the task when the prize isn't there? Like you want me to collect two car prizes but there are no cars to collect? Over all I enjoy this game.","The games okay but you really can't play long enough to make much progress. I stopped playing for a long time because the screen was cluttered with so much on top of machine you where playing. Also 99.99% of the time the ad pop-ups for free energy, grabs, etc... never worked. I came back after almost a year to check it out and I see nothing has changed. It has the potential to be a very relaxing de-stressing game to if they would make some screen improvements and fix the ad pop-ups.","Will change to 5 ☆ if the problem gets fixed... This is an awesome game and brings back many memories playing game's like this at the Arcade. But there are a few glitches interfering with this game... The Joy stick gets stuck and moves on it's own and other screen glitches. My friend downloaded it also and she has the same problems with the app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gamecircus.PrizeClaw","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamecircus.PrizeClaw&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"School of Dragons","description":"Fly fast, train hard, and learn well to become the Ultimate Dragon Trainer!

","comments":["Its a great game, and i would give it 5 stars, however, its is incredibly hard to accumulate gems if you dont have a membership. An idea as how to get more gems faster is to allow the players to sell unwanted dragon eggs, the rarer the egg the more gems you get. You could either take them to Johanns shop or sell them to other players. Another problem is that the game expansions cost so much, and if you dont grind gems and have a membership, you cant play. Other than that, its a great game.","Awesome game, Love the new event, however there are still issues such as not being able to login at times, glitches and bugs within game, animation/model bugs and loading screen bugs. I would love it if SOD fixed these before doing anything else with the game. Also there really isnt much to do after all the quests are done. Very nice game though I love it just need these bugs to be fixed.","I love this game so much. In my opinion, best game ever. But there is some glitches in the game. For example, when I try to get on armorwing island I just get stuck on the loading page forever and ever. That prevents me from finishing my quest. I have been trying everything to get on armorwing island, but nothing has worked. So maybe that can be one of the glitches, fixed in this game","Okay wow, this event has been a disaster. It keeps people from logging in, valkas sanctuary and now the quest board isn't working. Which for most people, is the main way to get notes. So far the only thing done is extending the event, but if it takes them a couple days to fix the board then that's going to affect us a lot. Seriously should of gone with an expansion pack.","It's honestly a great game. The only thing I'm complaining about is the fact that the only way to expand your adventure is by buying membership or paying ton of Money/Gems. I feel like that's ridiculous. And ever since 'SummerHildr ' or Whatnot event came, I've been having bugs and I can't even play my character. Was really looking forward to getting one of the nightlights.

If you’re starting to think that there are things beyond farming, put your farm sim on hold and start building your town that will gradually become a city, and then a megapolis with the best airport in the world! We know how plane games can become repetitive over time, so we are constantly improving this city simulator, to ensure that our players are always engaged, both on the ground and in the air.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to try out the role of an air tycoon or an airline commander, you’ll find something to love about Airport City. \r\n\r\nBuild a modern international-class terminal to send an airplane to whichever corner of the world you want. Just get your aircraft in the air and land them in any destination, from a faraway town to a shining megapolis. To make your travels memorable, you can bring back rare artifacts and unique collections. See how many souvenirs can fit in one aircraft!\r\nBut it’s not just a flight simulator—you’ll have to apply your outstanding management skills to develop all the supporting infrastructure too, in one of the most amazing airport games! Take care of the entire city next to it, to provide your airport all the required services.\r\n\r\nIf what you’re looking for in city building games is peaceful gameplay and interactions, this city simulator is exactly what you need. Here you start from a small town and develop it into a great megapolis!\r\nYou can create alliances with other players to complete joint quests and participate in competitions. Just find a fellow airline commander from a neighboring city and make your gaming experience twice as much fun! Regular updates with new models of aircraft, buildings, and new destinations, will become an infinite source of entertainment.\r\nDownload Airport City and see for yourself how this flight simulator stands out among other airplane games and city building games.\r\n\r\n✔ Test your airline commander skills, develop your own airport and build your own aircraft collection.\r\n✔ Take on the role of the ultimate tycoon.

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Blocky Cars: tank wars & robot games","description":"Welcome to the creative pixel car & tank world of Blocky Cars!\r\nWhat’s this online game about?

If I don't understand something I just go to the training section and practice till I get it right. Thank you, I'm a happy bunny!","I used to play this game all the time and I just keep coming back to it , it's so fun and it really makes you feel accomplished when you catch the fish you are looking for . I love fishing irl but some fish I can't catch irl but this game allows me to a Catch fish that I probably will never catch irl . But it does give you Joy","The gold crest has defeated me, I just feel I have paid for something I can't complete and feel a bit let down. I've failed over 50 times now and it's cost me too much time and game cash, I'm completely deflated now. It's so frustrating because it's something I paid for so it should be easier to complete but no, it's just sucking the life out of the game. It's time for me to quit now, this game just makes me angry.","Fun and interesting. Need some identification info for locations. Salt or fresh water, etc....","Amazing game n I don't mind adjusting my review to 4 stars from 1 since I noticed that now sum notifications can be quickly skipped during game play but I would luv to give you 5 stars instead if you can make it so that I can skip other notifications too like after catching a fish it tells me other player's scores and what crafting materials were acquired etc. Stuff like this really gets in the way when you just want to fish nonstop with no interruptions.
