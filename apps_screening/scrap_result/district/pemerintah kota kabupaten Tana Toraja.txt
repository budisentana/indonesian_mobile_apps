A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.)

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Moto Display","description":"Moto Display helps you stay informed and engaged, even when your screen is off.

I just want to show me the message and notification when my screen is turn off, Just it. But with this junk system, every time I receive anything I need to manual unlock the whole mobile, scroll down the notification bar to show if the notification. And more, the options is complete broken! It doesn't matter what I setup! If you set the \"touch to activated\" screen on or off, your mobile will keep awaking on your pocket every single second. Motorola never more!","I hate to admit that I didn't know I was using this app. It required no human interaction. I suppose it loads automatically. I'd probably had one to many, installed it and forgot overnight. I hate to admit that I thought it was malware intrusion. I love the app. I was looking for an aftn mirroring app and bingo Play Store showed a list, INSTALLED. I like the updates, didn't know I could push right or left to see more. Boy do I feel like a dunce😞","I think I have to keep it on my phone so I have it there but it doesn't really do much and it's just another clutter app which Google really likes as Android is Google and Google is Android which means that whatever phone you have especially if it's not rooted as mine is not, you get stuck with apps that you'd rather not have but here they are, meaning this is one of them for me.","I agree with others reviews, I would like to bring back the option to swipe down to dismiss notifications in the peek display. It was convenient that way, and it would be great if we could have that option at least, possibly being able to change in settings the set up. Update 6/9/21: it's a lot harder to peek at the screen/have everything show up when glancing at my phone. Now I have to bring it all the way up to my face to have the screen turn on, when I used to be able to just tilt it","Phone tries to do too much. Always video dual calling people at random.

It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle.

It is time consuming to find a house but fustrating to read about a house that was a no way not ever - over and over and over and over and over and over...get the point?","As I'm in the market to buy, the app has been invaluable. But I wish there was a way of removing listings from suggestions. If I view a home and decide it's not for me, I should have a way to stop seeing it appear on my suggestions. F/I a beautiful 4bd2bth at 90k but it's in a high crime or flood zone. I can favorite, but I can't refuse to see it.","Seems to be getting worse instead of better. I like that I can go to the listing and it's accurate. I wish every listing would be consistent in showing the rental Zestimate at the top or show unavailable if it isn't. The information is usually accurate and I like that there is a link to the county website for the property I'm looking at. The worst thing recently is that I can't update my property info without a real estate agent. Also miss the option to see public view on claimed homes.","Really like the zillow app, would be nice if the app alerted me when someone makes an offer on a property I saved. Would like to get into bidding wars on properties I want to buy. Missed many properties I would have paid more for. Would like to see properties sold on an ebay type format once qualified. Agents are not good about answering questions or making contact through zillow.","Doesn't work anymore. I get an email notification of a new house on the market, but when I click the link the app doesn't open that house. Instead it opens a list of hypothetically related houses. It honestly looks like an embedded web page, and behaves like one. It doesn't scroll properly buttons don't work.

There are 2 modes, system smash and planet smash. Planet smash has a large variety of things to destroy planets with, and you can create your own planets. System smash only has a few weapons, and its like universe sandbox in a way. A few things I would like to see, are a bit more weapons in the system smash, and a bit more realistic things, like if you melt the polar ice caps the world will flood. Once that is done, this is a 5 star game","It's good, but the 1 thing that really annoye me is I have tried getting the Cube World with the orange laser and the grid, but even though I make the best cube. I don't unlock it. So can you guys please fix it! I think other people around the world are suffering from it and are sad and mad. Its a really satisfying game it never gets you bored.","A fantastic and amazing game. Can't wait to see what other tools you guys come out with. Edit: One of the recent updates made the game not recognize my remove adverts purchase, and it doesn't allow me to make the purchase again. Hope this is fixed some point soon. Solar Smash is still great. Edit edit: Reinstalling seems to have helped. Nevermind.","Have had paid version for a little while, and enjoyed it a lot. But, now with the 3 new weapons, WOW! a LOT better. All 3 are entertaining as all get out. Highly recommend. NOTE: Even tho have paid version, after update (8/2/2021) I had a full screen ad show up. WHAT GIVES??","Extremely realistic graphics, a lot of planets, the new solar system mode is fun, you can modify the damage of some of the weapons, and.. it's a game to play in free time like 30 minutes. (fun fact: you can make the sun explode too)"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.paradyme.solarsmash","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paradyme.solarsmash&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"NewsBreak: Local News that Connects the Community","description":"News Break believes that local news is different.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much!

Horrible. 6-9-21: Just updated this app again & now it's working. 🤨 6-24-21: It stopped working again! 😡","Camer has not worked for over 2 months now. Never had this problem with a phone before. It does not work in any other app anymore either. It is 100% a moto camera app issue.","I loved my camera until this update! Whatever y'all did to \"fix\" zoomed/cropped photos STINKS and my photos now look like they were taken on a disposable camera from 1995 if I attempt to zoom or crop out superfluous background. Really wish there was an option to revert to earlier version. This is BAD and I've seriously been using my old inactive phone to take pics."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.motorola.camera2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motorola.camera2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Moto Gametime","description":"Moto Gametime is the ideal gaming companion, providing useful features that help you enjoy gaming on your Motorola phone.
