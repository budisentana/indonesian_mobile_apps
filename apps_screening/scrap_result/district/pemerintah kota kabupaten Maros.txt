How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home. So, instead of just opening the tracker in another browser tab, the developers in their infinite wisdom have decided that it is better if you unlock your phone, open the app, and then be able to locate.

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"WorldCraft: 3D Build & Block Craft","description":"★Welcome to WorldCraft - Best Crafting and Building 2020 Game Played by Thousands of Players ★\r\nPLAY NOW free creative online multiplayer games or survival exploration games.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GPS Route Finder : Maps Navigation & Directions","description":"GPS Route Finder : Maps Navigation & Directions provides variety of features such as GPS shortest Route finder, Driving route , Current Location, Maps Navigation, GPS Area Calculator, Distance Calculator, International subscriber dialing (ISD) or Country Codes, City Codes (STD) codes(USA, India, Pakistan), Altitude meter & more - make everything simple and easy! \r\n\r\nGPS Route Finder use GPS & Network to get your position on Map, Helps you Navigate Freely on maps and get you required directions.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features.

I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static. Still, it's great for people who use wired headphones. I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","The app work fine but when you quit an app it's notification keeps persistent for a couple of seconds. The app doesn't look very modern, it looks like it's from 2010. The app keep removing the names of radio stations I saved. So please fix it. Moreover this app doesn't support Android 11 media controls.","This app came preinstalled with my phone and is one of the few that I haven't tried to remove. It doesn't require an internet connection and so is the perfect go to entertainment when I have no mobile data. The sound quality is as good as any radio, with the convenience of having it on your mobile device. There are no in app purchases to unlock stations or premium features. It's the only radio I need.","Everything just works. Simple layout, doesn't need an internet connection and has useful features like recording.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun.

Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids<br><br><b>A safer online experience for kids</b><br>We work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.<br><br><b>Customize your child’s experience with Parental Controls<br>Limit screen time:</b> Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.<br><b>Keep up with what they watch:</b> Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.<br><b>Blocking:</b> Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.<br><b>Flagging:</b> You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<br><br><b>Create individual experiences as unique as your kids</b><br>Create up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”. <br><br>Select the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration.

Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

I made really good friends and it breaks my heart to leave them behind just because a stupid update won't let me continue playing! It would be much bettet if you didn't have to do so precise information for the account! Please fix this problem! I love this game and I don't want to leave it behind again! By that I mean I've had the game before and the same exact problem happend! Fix this please!","It's a cute app at times, but.. This is the least f2p player friendly app I've come across. If you don't have coins, your options are extremely limited. For example, much of the gacha are coin-based and only some feature diamonds, meaning you get bottom of the barrel items most of the time (if any). On top of that the diamond currency is also hard to acquire. Want to try to get items in events? Sorry! Those aren't very f2p friendly either, disappointed.","here are some things I'd like to see in the game: 1. being able to get the materials you want while trading with neighbors: it'd make crafting a lot more easier 2. the recording button 3. a way of leveling up the VIP status apart from the in-app purchases 4. the daily gems earned watching ads 5. the option to change your LinePLAY birthday to your real one 6.","This game is really the best game I played. But I would give it 5 stars if my account lasted. Everything was working very well when I tried to open it once and it showed me the screen the is shown when you have just downloaded the game. I tried to register my account but it said the my account wasn't even saved in line play. Please fix this I really loved this game and I don't want to uninstall it. I'll be waiting for an answer from the developer and make it fast.","for an expensive game, your staff sure have little care for fixing simple bugs. or is it intentional that you refrain players from watching ads, so they will purchase overpriced game currency? we pay with our time for viewing them, have some decency. frankly, all you have left is good item designs. even the new boss raid requires money to get the nicer prizes. when I said listen to your players for once, I didn't mean to give them more things to SPEND REAL MONEY ON."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"jp.naver.lineplay.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.naver.lineplay.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ben 10: Alien Experience","description":"Battle the bad guys in augmented reality and turn your selfies into Ben 10’s aliens with the Ben 10 Alien Experience!\r\n\r\nIMMERSIVE AR BATTLES\r\nUse augmented reality to surround yourself with 360 degrees of action!

This app is amazing... but the issue is. On my galaxy A11, the app works smoothly when I open the app, then after a few minutes staying on the app it starts to lag. When it gets really bad it either locks up my phone, black screen, and or the app closing out by itself... I want to enjoy the full experience of the app because I love to explore. Thank you.","Typing in the search box was impossible. Letters were erasing themselves as I was typing. I updated my Gboard. The same thing happened. Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.) Also a really useful feature would be a wildfire layer in Voyager.

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GT Racing 2: real car game","description":"Leadership: possibly the best handheld racing simulation/h2>\r\n• The richest handheld racing simulation game this year: 71 licensed cars on 13 tracks, including the real Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.\r\n• A superb collection of real cars from over 30 manufacturers: Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari, Dodge, Nissan, Audi, Ford, and more.\r\n• Test your driving skills by completing 1,400 events, including Classic Races, Duels, Knockouts and Overtakes.\r\n• 28 new challenges each week: improve your driving skills & maybe win a new car for free.\r\n\r\nA deeper driving sensation\r\n• The new physics model offers the most realistic car dynamics ever offered in a handheld game.\r\n• The sun is not always shining in GT Racing 2: Our tracks have different times of day and weather conditions.\r\n• Race your way by choosing from among 4 different cameras, including a breathtaking interior view, and feast your eyes on real car designs.\r\n• No repair times or repair costs!

No repairs, and no need to wait. But now, I installed it on the same phone but different account. It doesn't work now, and I don't know why. It says \"you have no internet access\", which is ironice, since I am on internet. But when I go to my original account, it works, so I'm not sure why.

There's no way to drift. Club feature doesn't make much sense; I can't race with club members","First of all, I don't understand why people hate this game just because of it's sim-cade graphics. Gameloft has done a good job with the physics of the game and the quality of such a game coming from 2012 is just so underrated. The physics of the game is sim cade and is easy for beginners. New cars and new locations can be added too. Recently, there has also been a big in which the game runs in 2X speed. I hope the devs take care of this issue","My queston is why did some of the cars get removed, and why did my FAVORITE SONG get removed? (The car amount used to be 81 acording to one of pictures) [example: tesla model S which had B class] i remember when i played this in 2017... Why would those cars and song get removed? (This is making me sad...) :( I dont know what the reason is for those things getting you know, removed. If these things come back, I would be very happy, but no one, including me will ever know. If they are back, 5*","Guys, in overall graphics, gameplay, controls, cars, views, maps and the mechanics itself is a BIG \"THUMBS UP\" literally as a car enthusiast, I could say that this is one of the best car game that've made...

Edit: it's pretty stupid people are complaining about having to pay after 3 levels because a normal Mario game is 60$, I feel it's a lot better than charging 10$ up front because you can have a trial of the game, something most payed mobile games can't say. It is annoying that you have to play on wifi But it's ok","This game is really fun, brings back lots of memories of being a kid so frustrated at a level because I can't beat it. I love it. One complaint is I had finished the game 100% but on my old phone and when I signed in to Nintendo on my new phone it wouldn't transfer my levels completed so I now have to play the entire game again. Not too mad though it gave me a reason to play it again.","It was good but I don't like how you have to pay for the full game as you can't go past level 3 without paying. But altogether it is a fun and all the levels are diverse and will entertain you a lot. Even if you complete all the levels there are always high scores you can beat, coins you can collect, and baddies you can smash! I would recommend this to all ages. Just keep in mind you might need to pay for the full experience.","It's a pretty good game and I really like it. There is multyplayer, story mode and remix 10 which is kind of a invite game mode where you can unlock different stuff. But I only gave 4 stars. And that's for a reason! Because after playing the first World you have to pay atound 10€ which I think is to much for a mobile game especially if it doesn't give that much new content after the purchase.","The game is really fun and I've never had a problem with it. They released new stuff over time to keep it fresh but I'm just now coming back to it so not sure what they are doing currently. I can't believe people have the audacity to complain about the price when so many people put so much more money into \"free\" games. I would much rather pay a fixed price that honestly isn't bad at all; Especially considering it is actually fun and well thought out unlike 99% of the games found in the store."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.nintendo.zara","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zara&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Top Speed: Drag & Fast Racing","description":"Dominate your criminally insane rivals in extreme head-to-head drag races!\r\n\r\n• Pick from 69 cars: stock rides, dragsters, and police vehicles\r\n• Let your creativity flow through a ton of tuning and customization options\r\n• Drive in 5 city districts, each with its own unique theme and gang crew\r\n• A real-life inspired aircraft carrier to race on\r\n• Epic arcade game modes\r\n• Adrenaline inducing Most Wanted police chases\r\n• Mind-blowing 3D HD visuals\r\n\r\nReach impossible speeds by expertly timing gear changes and bursts of nitro\r\nTop Speed is setting the new standard within drag racing genre.

None of the FAQs or the Support topics address this issue, and I can't find a way to ask for assistance with this issue via the app itself. This is making the app less effective for me b/c it's a hassle to sign in every time I use it and it might not be providing accurate information when it times out.","There is no way to reset the password if your email account is not valid. My child deleted the app and when i reinstalled I can't remember the password. She doesn't have email on her phone and her school email i used is no longer valid. Contacted help to request they delete the phone number so I can start over. Nothing back. Might have to go to a different app for all family members if I can't get this fixed.","This app is a trash. Your location is shown only when you are active in the app otherwise you can't track the device you're looking for. It shows \"the device data/wifi has been turned off since...\". I lost my phone and couldn't trace it but the phone itself was turned on with data.","Love the fact it shows when my family makes it home safely. I really like this app, and I'm just using the free version. But, the pro plan is only $7.99/month","I noticed that it says my daughter is in a different location, like 12 miles away. Last update was 18 March, really needs more frequent updating"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.fsp.android.phonetracker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsp.android.phonetracker&hl=en&gl=us"}]
