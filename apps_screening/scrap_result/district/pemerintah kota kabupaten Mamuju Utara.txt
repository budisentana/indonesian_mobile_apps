I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness.

This app is amazing... but the issue is. On my galaxy A11, the app works smoothly when I open the app, then after a few minutes staying on the app it starts to lag. When it gets really bad it either locks up my phone, black screen, and or the app closing out by itself... I want to enjoy the full experience of the app because I love to explore. Thank you.","Typing in the search box was impossible. Letters were erasing themselves as I was typing. I updated my Gboard. The same thing happened. Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. üôÇ Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.) Also a really useful feature would be a wildfire layer in Voyager.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn‚Äôt start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful.

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly.

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features.

There are 2 modes, system smash and planet smash. Planet smash has a large variety of things to destroy planets with, and you can create your own planets. System smash only has a few weapons, and its like universe sandbox in a way. A few things I would like to see, are a bit more weapons in the system smash, and a bit more realistic things, like if you melt the polar ice caps the world will flood. Once that is done, this is a 5 star game","It's good, but the 1 thing that really annoye me is I have tried getting the Cube World with the orange laser and the grid, but even though I make the best cube. I don't unlock it. So can you guys please fix it! I think other people around the world are suffering from it and are sad and mad. Its a really satisfying game it never gets you bored.","A fantastic and amazing game. Can't wait to see what other tools you guys come out with. Edit: One of the recent updates made the game not recognize my remove adverts purchase, and it doesn't allow me to make the purchase again. Hope this is fixed some point soon. Solar Smash is still great. Edit edit: Reinstalling seems to have helped. Nevermind.","Have had paid version for a little while, and enjoyed it a lot. But, now with the 3 new weapons, WOW! a LOT better. All 3 are entertaining as all get out. Highly recommend. NOTE: Even tho have paid version, after update (8/2/2021) I had a full screen ad show up. WHAT GIVES??","Extremely realistic graphics, a lot of planets, the new solar system mode is fun, you can modify the damage of some of the weapons, and.. it's a game to play in free time like 30 minutes. (fun fact: you can make the sun explode too)"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.paradyme.solarsmash","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paradyme.solarsmash&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Flightradar24 Flight Tracker","description":"The world's most popular flight tracker - #1 Travel app in over 150 countries. \r\n\r\nTurn your phone or tablet into a live plane tracker and see flights around the world move in real-time on a detailed map.

Opened the app and it showed a single engine Pilatus turboprop. Also listed the wrong destination. I'm in the initial approach for HPN where this jet was clearly landing, but listed as heading to Montauk. This happened two other times in the last week. Been using app for years, never had this happen before. I updated app and still showed bad info. What's up guys?","Have enjoyed several years of silver level but notice planes taxiing to runway, waiting for ages, then gone, suddenly airborne at speed and off the screen. Used to be able to track acceleration and liftoff. It needs to be made clearer what times mean. I thought they were local to where the aircraft was, but I think they must be local to where I am, ie Auckland, NZ","I love this App and always use it to identify the Aircraft going in to my local Airport and to follow their journey. I find it very informative and entertaining and would recommend it to anyone with similar aviation interests. Update 6/8: I have just found that a lot of features are accessed by Search Bar and am absolutely loving it now. Upgraded to Silver Package. Well and truly addicted!","I love this app! I have a Gold subscription but as of lately its not picking up all the aircraft thats right above my head.....I can physically hear and see them, but they are not showing in my app...","Love thus App!

Secondly the car is the weak spot, back then you had to target the soft spot to destroy a car wich was challenging now its brainless and needs no effort. Back then I would have given this a 5 star now I would give it 0 it is now pay to win its sad to say because I loved this game","Absolutely loving the game, very entertaining... except, what happened the all the players? The chat thread is empty, I'm seeing nothing but bots (ai enemies) in all my matches, and I can't seem to catch any players in a match... did I do something wrong? Please help me. Edit: I was just running my daily tasks, and I THINK I found a player... idk, I'm beginning to think the game died lol","It's a great and entertaining game for certain but my account was lost due to me signing someone else's google play account out.Now I've lost everything, please fix this.I will ensure to rate five stars if this issue is solved.","For me the upgrades are way to expensive because before I could get everything only with coins and now everything costs these blue coins. The upgrades are way to expensive one upgrade costs 179 blue coins I could buy a new weapon with 179 blue coins","this is a cool game I like the way like a battle royal or something I like when you can make your own car I really like it you should try it ima keep playing so I can keep getting level up"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.blockycars.online","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockycars.online&hl=en&gl=us"}]
