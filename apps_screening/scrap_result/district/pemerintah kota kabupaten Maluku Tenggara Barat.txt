Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GPS Route Finder : Maps Navigation & Directions","description":"GPS Route Finder : Maps Navigation & Directions provides variety of features such as GPS shortest Route finder, Driving route , Current Location, Maps Navigation, GPS Area Calculator, Distance Calculator, International subscriber dialing (ISD) or Country Codes, City Codes (STD) codes(USA, India, Pakistan), Altitude meter & more - make everything simple and easy! \r\n\r\nGPS Route Finder use GPS & Network to get your position on Map, Helps you Navigate Freely on maps and get you required directions.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate.

Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game.

It is much more than your average city simulator or one of the tycoon games. It takes the best of two worlds in just the right proportions: the sense of adventure from airplane games, and the need to plan strategically from the city simulators. If you’re starting to think that there are things beyond farming, put your farm sim on hold and start building your town that will gradually become a city, and then a megapolis with the best airport in the world! We know how plane games can become repetitive over time, so we are constantly improving this city simulator, to ensure that our players are always engaged, both on the ground and in the air.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to try out the role of an air tycoon or an airline commander, you’ll find something to love about Airport City. \r\n\r\nBuild a modern international-class terminal to send an airplane to whichever corner of the world you want. Just get your aircraft in the air and land them in any destination, from a faraway town to a shining megapolis. To make your travels memorable, you can bring back rare artifacts and unique collections. See how many souvenirs can fit in one aircraft!\r\nBut it’s not just a flight simulator—you’ll have to apply your outstanding management skills to develop all the supporting infrastructure too, in one of the most amazing airport games! Take care of the entire city next to it, to provide your airport all the required services.\r\n\r\nIf what you’re looking for in city building games is peaceful gameplay and interactions, this city simulator is exactly what you need.

It is much more than your average city simulator or one of the tycoon games. It takes the best of two worlds in just the right proportions: the sense of adventure from airplane games, and the need to plan strategically from the city simulators.

We know how plane games can become repetitive over time, so we are constantly improving this city simulator, to ensure that our players are always engaged, both on the ground and in the air.<br><br>Whether you want to try out the role of an air tycoon or an airline commander, you’ll find something to love about Airport City. <br><br>Build a modern international-class terminal to send an airplane to whichever corner of the world you want. Just get your aircraft in the air and land them in any destination, from a faraway town to a shining megapolis. To make your travels memorable, you can bring back rare artifacts and unique collections. See how many souvenirs can fit in one aircraft!<br>But it’s not just a flight simulator—you’ll have to apply your outstanding management skills to develop all the supporting infrastructure too, in one of the most amazing airport games! Take care of the entire city next to it, to provide your airport all the required services.<br><br>If what you’re looking for in city building games is peaceful gameplay and interactions, this city simulator is exactly what you need. Here you start from a small town and develop it into a great megapolis!<br>You can create alliances with other players to complete joint quests and participate in competitions.

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"YouTube Kids","description":"A video app made just for kids\r\nYouTube Kids was created to give kids a more contained environment filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness.

I love it. It's nice to have a game for toddlers! My only problem is that it's for children.

It is very hard for me to get comfortable with my tiny phone screen to do my banking. It is very easy to make mistakes, too ! TAKE YOUR TIME, MAKE SURE OF EACH ENTRY BEFORE MOVING ON !!! The convenience of not having to visit a banking location (which is farther and farther away) makes learning how to use the app worth the effort.","As others have stated, the app used to be excellent and now it's got issues. I noticed recently that the quick balance check feature had disappeared and could no longer find it as an opt in/out of option. Today I went to log in and the portal looks sketchy so I did not complete entering my password because it didn't seem legit. It looks \"cheaper\" for lack of a better word. I have had total confidence in the security of the app but recent changes don't appear to be a benefit to users so far.","The app does not function properly. I update it all the time, including today, and its still the same issue. It always freezes upon opening and it seems like i can only open it and sign in once a week. It wont let me enter my sign in info all the time. Thats very inconvenient when I need it. Please look into it. The bank would have so much more money right now if the problem wasnt so persistent.","Been using this app for years. For some reason you have made it more difficult to use. It used to look just like it did online you could pull it up and all your bills were on one page with when you made your last payment and when the next is due. Now you have to look around and change pages to do the same thing and if you don't have ebills or if they are not offered it does not show last payment. After closing all the branches near me I have had to open an account at a local credit union.","App is stuck! I sign in and it goes straight to a screen about if I want to sign up for mobile alerts, but you can't hit any of the options or get to the accounts you're stuck on a dead screen! I've been using this for years and now its completely unusable. I have a broken foot and depended on the app to make my deposits now I have to pay for a ride to and from the bank and have to hop on my crutches to make a deposit 🙃"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.infonow.bofa","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infonow.bofa&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"MapFactor Navigator - GPS Navigation Maps","description":"* Best rated free offline navigation app on Google Play with 35 mil+ installs*\r\nNow for Android Auto as well!\r\n\r\nMapFactor Navigator is a free GPS navigation app with free offline maps from OpenStreetMaps (incl. free monthly maps update).

I deleted the files but the app no longer runs without them. Is it so complicated to have a big button to just turn off the voice assist that to me is as annoying a Karen telling what to do?","It has changed a lot since I used it in the passed, less intuitive. Obviously need to read the manual and then re-review.","The app can take 2 or three tries to fully function in Android Auto. That's a problem. Also it does not matter what channel or volume you set in the app the voice engine will cut out source audio. You can have the voice or you can have silence but you can't navigate to a point and listen to anything without interruption. Unless there is a solution the developer will not share this app is not ready for Primetime.","Closing the app in system task manager caused that all my saved routes GONE! Same thing with blocked roads edited by myself. All gone. Need to fix this or set a reminder for users that they always have to close the app proper using 'Exit', not just killing it in task manager. BTW. 'average speed' panel doesn't work.","Maps not bad (OSM); interface/search atrocious. Example: asks for country; type United it prompts with Kingdom, back up, type States - frowny face. Must type name of state, which isn't a country. When you get a possibility there is no \"show on map\" except in various unfathomable contexts. Getting beyond Last Search takes gymnastics and a few MAJOR shopping centers in my area not in database. So, free, navigation OK, UI big flunk. Needs real user input + UI/workflow redesign.

To honor this grand occasion, King Ludwig has organised a host of special anniversary events and rewards for your pleasure. Thank you all for your many years of loyalty; we could not have asked for better lords and ladies!","comments":["This game was brilliant, and I had played it for many years, however the \"blacksmith balancing update\" has made the game impossible to play, for anyone who doesn't spend money. I think about half of the players have stopped playing now. What the developers haven't seen, is that if the spenders don't have anyone who doesn't spend to compete with, they won't have to spend as much to get the same rewards, so the game developers wi get less money I hope this change is reverted soon. Thanks.","Decided to play game with friends and family, only to find out moving servers is a total loss (monies already spent and game money in my account) and I would have to start all over. Has been completely disappointing and never a response from games customer support. Don't waste money on this game as can clearly see they do not listen players and have no concern for them. I suggest looking for something more player friendly. Can see how they created empire by stealing from players.","One has to pay too high a price in real dollar$ and game coins for what you're needing to advance while playing this game. I also learned the hard way, that you have very little chance against Ruby players who are unethical bullies, whether they are players and/or Alliances. There's no recourse when players and Alliances do not follow the rules of the game. Also, why can't you play the game without downloading the updates?","After I updated the game it was demanding update again. so I deleted and installed the app to get rid of the bug. Since I couldn't remember my password I requested a password change but I noticed the game server is also changed and my progress is gone. The game can also be laggy most of the times. It is a good old game but not suitable for modern times and it has very bad bugs. most of players are inactive.","It's a good game overall, except when ever the game has it's bugs... Which seems to happen A LOT.... But what surprised me the most, was that this company gave me my money back. This review used to be vary different, I complained about losing money by buying some stuff and not getting it... Know I'm leaving my review with 4 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"air.com.goodgamestudios.empirefourkingdoms","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.goodgamestudios.empirefourkingdoms&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"TuneIn Radio: News, Sports & Online Music Stations","description":"FROM NOW ON, THIS IS RADIO.\r\n\r\nTuneIn brings together live news, sports, music, podcasts and radio stations from around the world.\r\n\r\nWith live and on-demand audio from the voices you trust, on any device, you're never without something amazing to listen to.\r\n\r\nALL YOUR AUDIO IN ONE APP.\r\n\r\n• News: Listen to and stay informed with live 24/7 news from local, national and global news sources, including CNBC, CNN, MSNBC, FOX News Radio, NPR and BBC.\r\n\r\n• Sports:  Listen to live NFL, NHL, and college games, anywhere you go, plus local, national, and global sports talk stations.

For technical help, please email appstore@tunein.com.","comments":["Pretty good app overall, but one major negative is that it loses connection a lot and every time I hit pause, even if it's just for a few seconds, the app makes me listen to a 30 second ad! Very, very very annoying when I'm listening to a live sports game! Please stop being so greedy and fix this issue! Put like a 5 minute grace period in or something reasonable.","Enjoy this application for many years now. However, recently I am having issues with the sleep timer on my favorite radio station. Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","It's a good app, you can access 1000s of stations but one of the joys that made it similar to listening to a real live radio was the sleep timer feature. It's not working on the current version for some reason which is a shame and a pain. Not an issue if listening during the day, I would imagine though.","App often goes into endless cycle of ads and doesn't return to radio station I'm listening to. I understand having ads when I'm not paying for subscription but I just listened to 20 minutes of ads and had to turn off because it won't return to radio station I was listening to. Have to close, reopen, listen to more ads then back to station. And then when radio station returns from its own commercial break TuneIn will suddenly cut to its own ads & begins endless cycle of ads w/o return to station."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"tunein.player","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PlayKids - Cartoons, Books and Educational Games","description":"Children learn to read, watch videos, and read ebooks.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going.

It's really a great game. Rephrase that. If money wasn't the top priority this app would be so awesome for all consumers to enjoy. If u don't have 100 bucks a week to spend at the least. Don't play ffxv.","You can play free to play but its made so that some items are only available for a limited time or never and if you miss them you have to wait until they are offered as a prize months later. The p2p players can gift others a catch up token which often includes things past the paywall which is nice. Its a war game much much more than a city building one. Tries to get you to spend $. And different pack offers based on spending tier.","This game is legitimate garbage. All it does is drag the final fantasy name through the mud. You try and play and just get one tapped by someone 2 levels above you since they love balancing to make players spend money. If you don't spend or know people who will help you by spending than you're not gonna go anywhere. The support, sorry \"support\" actually told me when I have issues its my fault. I asked about the scaling of their events. They said its only for high levels spend money. GG Greed","I give it 5 stars cause it has helped me thru very tough times. Being able to talk communicate and strategize with other players. Never experienced anything like it. I was able to stay out of trouble and to better my life at same time. We all experience difficulties on buying packs. But truthfully I'm seeing people that has not spent money are hardly any catch up to the rest of us that do spend regularly.This is why buying the empire boosts are a must.This is what makes you better. GOD bless","0/10 Would not recommend. Pros: If you don't value your time and money, Congratulations you are the target audience for this game. Cons: 1) A window pops-up every 10 seconds telling you to spend money and you can't tell it to go away for the day like some other games with a similar pop-up. 2) The game doesn't really have anything to do with FF. They just took a poorly made game and through-in some pngs of ffXV characters.
