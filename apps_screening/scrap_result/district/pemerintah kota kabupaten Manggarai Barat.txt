It's really a great game. Rephrase that. If money wasn't the top priority this app would be so awesome for all consumers to enjoy. If u don't have 100 bucks a week to spend at the least. Don't play ffxv.","You can play free to play but its made so that some items are only available for a limited time or never and if you miss them you have to wait until they are offered as a prize months later. The p2p players can gift others a catch up token which often includes things past the paywall which is nice. Its a war game much much more than a city building one. Tries to get you to spend $. And different pack offers based on spending tier.","This game is legitimate garbage. All it does is drag the final fantasy name through the mud. You try and play and just get one tapped by someone 2 levels above you since they love balancing to make players spend money. If you don't spend or know people who will help you by spending than you're not gonna go anywhere. The support, sorry \"support\" actually told me when I have issues its my fault. I asked about the scaling of their events. They said its only for high levels spend money. GG Greed","I give it 5 stars cause it has helped me thru very tough times. Being able to talk communicate and strategize with other players. Never experienced anything like it. I was able to stay out of trouble and to better my life at same time. We all experience difficulties on buying packs. But truthfully I'm seeing people that has not spent money are hardly any catch up to the rest of us that do spend regularly.This is why buying the empire boosts are a must.This is what makes you better. GOD bless","0/10 Would not recommend. Pros: If you don't value your time and money, Congratulations you are the target audience for this game. Cons: 1) A window pops-up every 10 seconds telling you to spend money and you can't tell it to go away for the day like some other games with a similar pop-up. 2) The game doesn't really have anything to do with FF. They just took a poorly made game and through-in some pngs of ffXV characters.

The first page it opens when you click on the app, says that the service is offline. And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ice Age Village","description":"Embark on a fun and frozen journey through the Ice Age universe.

Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little. But they slowed the car like WAY too much."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rkgames.smashywanted","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rkgames.smashywanted&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Amsterdam Offline City Map","description":"Your comprehensive and easy-to-use city map.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate.

Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building.

Tri-Rail schedule changes all the time and PDFs online show the wrong dates and times usually. the website is not usable from the cell phone you have to pinch everything to see it. train stops early weekends and weekdays preventing does it really need the system from actually using it. great concept but horribly executed.

Has features I didn't even know that I should be demanding out of a radar until now. Only wish there was a way to connect the alerts to the head unit that I play music on. They both use Bluetooth so I'm sure that that's the reason likely due to my phones software (Nord N10), but if you guys can help figure it out that'd be great!! No complaints either way!","Nice features, the map shows where previously confirmed items are, radar trap, red light scamera etc. Mute and manage the Cobra from the app. However, the battery usage on my Note9 is very high, even when it's \"off\". I may have to remove it. As others have mentioned, I have to force close the app, big PITA. I'd also like to see mapping and directions integrated with the map.","Has a map but doesn't navigate? What's the point? Needs an actual way to close the app. There is no reason for this to run constantly on my phone. I have to force stop it or reboot my phone when not using it. Would be nice if alets came through Bluetooth so they would come over my radio.","Was leary at first from all the reviews. However, instead of rushing through and getting it in the window, I took my time. Yes registering is a bit of a pain, however if done correctly, you will be directed back to the app, then re-log in. This is NOT a navigation app. It is to run in the background and feed info (bluetooth) to the Detector to give awareness. Users these days just haven't any sense, and most shouldnt be having one of these as they don't need to be speeding.","Awesome app love the ability to control my cobra from my phone, love the added features, love just about everything, why 4 stars? battery drain is ridiculous, connecting to my device has been buggy, the only way to exit the app completely is to force close it, it requires access to my location at all times even when the app is supposed to be closed this is not optional if you wish to use your membership, and the settings and what they mean and do as well as the functions not explained well."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.cobra.iradar","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cobra.iradar&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ben 10: Alien Experience","description":"Battle the bad guys in augmented reality and turn your selfies into Ben 10’s aliens with the Ben 10 Alien Experience!\r\n\r\nIMMERSIVE AR BATTLES\r\nUse augmented reality to surround yourself with 360 degrees of action!
