How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home. So, instead of just opening the tracker in another browser tab, the developers in their infinite wisdom have decided that it is better if you unlock your phone, open the app, and then be able to locate.

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Android Auto","description":"Android Auto is your smart driving companion that helps you stay focused, connected, and entertained with the Google Assistant.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going.

But one thing that i want to change is that if person is walking then this also shows the kilometres or speed if it is change according to the activity of an individual like if someone drive a car or who wheeler the small sign is show at the location. If you solve this problem then there to nothing to say any negative point of this application. Thanks.","The ads make this app very creepy. Like you are such an invasive friend and a terrible one if you use this app to check on your friends when they say \"oh battery's dead\" or something. That's creepy. Plus half the things you say in the ad doesn't make sense. Any way you advertise this app is just gonna make it look creepy and kinda stalkerish. Other than that, your replys to most of these reviews are quite nice.","Zenly is a very cool app. I used it every day. After that, I updated the firmware version and now it does not work ... Endless loading on the background of ice cream (after registration and delivery of all permissions). I really want to use it, but I can't anymore... Waiting for help! 🆘","The app is perfect and one thing they should fix is battery optimization if you could add something like sleeping mode which will freeze the location untill we turn it off again. so that battery would not drain faster at that time","At first it was ok, when I update the apps suddenly cannot locate the loaction and its not accurate.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"India News, Latest News App, Live News Headlines","description":"NewsPoint is a news app that presents the latest news in crisp format from trusted national and international publishers.

Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more ..

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much! Saying that the local news I receive is great and helps keep me

Loud ads KILL this app!!!! It is so annoying to have the alarm go off and then have to wait 5 or 10 seconds through an annoying ad before I can shut that off. It especially sucks if you have someone else in the bed with you who gets up later. Yeah, the wife gets pissed off because it wakes her up completely. \"Sorry honey, just waot for the annoying ad with the jackhammer sound then go back to sleep.\" Yeah right. Silent ads are ok","Last couple of nights my alarm hasn't gone off, I've never had this problem and I've had the app for about 3 years. At first I thought I turned my alarm off but when I went into the app the app said my alarms were still on so I don't really know what the problem is. Maybe it is my fault when the problem is solved ill definitely give 5 stars, and I love the app alot better than the default alarm app","One big flaw with this app is that for whatever reason if YouTube is open, the alarm you have set will get turned off at some point. I like to sleep to audio; like rain or a video and this has caused me to be, in some real world cases; late (including today as I am writing this review!). If not for this weakness that literally defeats the point of having this app, I would rate higher because overall for it's ease of access and use.","Customer service was fast and good to work with. Still a great program. Thanks for all the help. Dean Love the program. I purchased it a while back and all was good until just recently. It now has ads. The problem is I have 3 Google accounts for different emails and it is looking at 1 that I didn't use to purchase it with. If I delete the account it shows paid. If I add it back it has ads. It didn't use to do this. Any help would be great.","very flexible alarm. Different alarms, many different ways to be woken.This is the only alarm that actually works well with Google. I use the solve the math expression way they provide.. I just wish the display wasn't so dark- its very slow to brighten up by sliding fingers up and down. Just wish there were a light theme or factory theme choice. Max brightness is what I want. Especially during the day .

These were easy enough to ignore. Recently it's just gotten out of control, with ads in the file system, ads before you can use the other features, and in the past couple days, it's opening ads in my browser. This is unacceptable. If I had the money I would get a new phone just to be free of this app.","Every time it auto pops clean With every cleaning, there is a series of junk advertisements Accidentally, you click and it goes on website Plus you can not delete it. Force stop creates additional trouble ... It always pops up again. It is mandatory extortion. I have 3 Alcatel pieces, 2 tablets and a phone. All are creating problems. I am installing new Android and will never ever vouch for Alcatel again. I had been one of the biggest Alcatel fan, but this has killed it all. Pl stop cleaner","Starting to get ad spam. Annoying as heck. Phone goes off each time I use it to clean ad junk. Sick of the spam. Can't uninstall or force stop on this stupid app. Keeps resetting to restart. I sent screenshot and email. Will update on how support handled this complaint.","I would have put nil for this rateing but it does a good job.BUT they keep on shoving this cleaning ad. for phone and its near impossible to get rid unless you do what they want and go to play store to see there app.nearly forgot the games ads.dont know what is worse.","I never take the time to leave bad reviwes however pissed I get at an app... But I had to do this. First, why are you trying so hard to force me to use your cleaner app? This app for fike managing, get your game together, I don't want it. I should be able to at least decide not to use the functionality. Second, stop putting ads on the app everywhere.

Why did the ad and a question to exit the app have to be added? Please, get rid of that annoyance. The app already had a permanent ad on the bottom and ads in some other places, which was understandable and absolutely fine. This just adds an unnecessary action when you want to close it and interferes with ease of use. And the back button is treated as 'no' as well, great. :)","Used to be a great app but have noticed that recently the weather is completely inaccurate. Even as I write this, it's raining quite heavily outside & yet the app is showing something completely different. No point downloading the app if the info is completely false/wrong.","I appreciate this app because I live in northern manitoba. It's pretty good at amending the forecast when weather has changed.

It will do the job but make you hate yourself for it. The interface is very heavy feeling and at times a pain to navigate. Its like trying to take a detour with no signs. They have catagories... sorta, but I am convinced it was just a program vomiting content after a night of cheap liquor. It has the vibe of a designed team that remember their assignment 3 hours before the deadline. Bring a GPS you're going to need it to find your way around.","More adds than video content. Often the videos fail, but don't worry the advertisements never do. If you try to rewatch a 10 second clip that recently failed, you'll have to watch the advertisement again, which never fails to run. Unacceptable for a company as large as it is, and owned by Disney. Get it together boys and girls....You should be better than this. I pay a monthly subscription for this, rediculous!","Incredibly terrible app for this size company. Load times are awful, there are 30 second unskippable commercials that freeze, so you wait 2 minutes to watch 25 seconds of content followed by more commercials. The watch app is terrible, I have espn+ membership but I'm unable to watch games that are on broadcast television like ABC, because I don't have a cable membership. Their watch section is laid out terribly and it's vague what you are able to watch with your membership. So bad.","If it weren't a dang monopoly, I would've deleted this app years ago. Slow load times, has no problem loading 40 second ads, but then won't load the 10 second highlight you came to see. But wait, try to find the highlight anywhere else, and it'll kick you back to their app. Please, for the love of God, can yahoo, or fox sports, or literally anyone make a half decent app for sports. I'll take it over this dumpster fire any day","Horrible lag in the app. Also it does a horrendous job playing videos. The big issue is the handoff from ad to content. And even when the video is playing, of you change the time on the video, it won't respond and will skip the video. Would have expected a lot more from a big company, bit the app has bee. Awful for several years now"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.espn.score_center","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espn.score_center&hl=en&gl=us"}]
