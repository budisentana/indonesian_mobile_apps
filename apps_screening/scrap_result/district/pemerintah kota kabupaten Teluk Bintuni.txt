What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth! Had huge glitch on my game play, took a couple of weeks to fix, they got it done!!! Thank you all. Awesome job well done. Totally locked in forever. 👍👍 Once again the Tech Team has stepped up to Excellence. Thanks 😊 7.21.21","Fantastic idea ! 2 stars missing because this game does not load properly. Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building. It also have military, airport, railway, minerals, space oruented,....etc 3.In each and every places has unique song i really have enjoyed it. 4.

What a waste of time it was you need different speed ups for different things like troops for example there is no generic speed up for all troop types but multiple types of speed ups you can only use for certain class plus for me to progress from where I left I have to spend a tonne of money I cant upgrade or do research unless I buy packs this is not a free to play game. It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!!

The first page it opens when you click on the app, says that the service is offline. And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Airport City - transport manager","description":"Airport games are a true adventure, and Airport City is among the best!

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Sygic GPS Navigation & Offline Maps","description":"Sygic GPS, Navigation is the world’s most downloaded Offline GPS navigation app, trusted by more than 200 million drivers.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Indian Railway Train Status : Where is my Train","description":"Live running train status, time tables, station status, PNR enquiry with prediction, a unique berth & seat calc, and reservation date calc for Indian Railways.\r\n\r\nAmaze your co-travellers by telling them \"Hmmmm.. we are running twenty minutes late\", without looking outside!\r\n\r\nFor the first time ever, introducing split RAC and Confirmation chances for PNR prediction.

These were easy enough to ignore. Recently it's just gotten out of control, with ads in the file system, ads before you can use the other features, and in the past couple days, it's opening ads in my browser. This is unacceptable. If I had the money I would get a new phone just to be free of this app.","Every time it auto pops clean With every cleaning, there is a series of junk advertisements Accidentally, you click and it goes on website Plus you can not delete it. Force stop creates additional trouble ... It always pops up again. It is mandatory extortion. I have 3 Alcatel pieces, 2 tablets and a phone. All are creating problems. I am installing new Android and will never ever vouch for Alcatel again. I had been one of the biggest Alcatel fan, but this has killed it all. Pl stop cleaner","Starting to get ad spam. Annoying as heck. Phone goes off each time I use it to clean ad junk. Sick of the spam. Can't uninstall or force stop on this stupid app. Keeps resetting to restart. I sent screenshot and email. Will update on how support handled this complaint.","I would have put nil for this rateing but it does a good job.BUT they keep on shoving this cleaning ad. for phone and its near impossible to get rid unless you do what they want and go to play store to see there app.nearly forgot the games ads.dont know what is worse.","I never take the time to leave bad reviwes however pissed I get at an app... But I had to do this. First, why are you trying so hard to force me to use your cleaner app? This app for fike managing, get your game together, I don't want it. I should be able to at least decide not to use the functionality. Second, stop putting ads on the app everywhere. Nothing is more annoying and can't see my files without getting enraged by an ad, you're making the app unnecessarily heavy to fulfill its purpose."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jrdcom.filemanager","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrdcom.filemanager&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Smashy Road: Wanted","description":"SMASHY ROAD: WANTED\r\n\r\nYou are WANTED!

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

I would like to see when it asks for my age to also have the option to just sign-in to google play games where my entire city is backed up on. Its extreamly frustrating and after all these years I highly doubt I am the only one.","It's a great game, playing for a few years, will keep playing. Would like to see more design element control. Turn off building upgrades, even force no upgrades. While you can play, it's rather 'pay'. My children can't get far in this game. They need $$$. I don't mind paying, yet this game is a cash cow ! Very greedy game. Visit another city you may get $5, that's like worth 10 cents. Not a great reward. War rewards are terrible. Global trade hq, always hiding what you need. EA reward time !","Had a good time with this for a day, until I hit level that unlocks schools and transportation. Then I realized it would take forever to get the money for those buildings, and that's when the game so conveniently showed me some rather expensive options to get them immediately. Of course it did... Typical EA. Uninstalled.","Halfway decent game Graphics are cool, but unfortunately just like every other game out there on any tablet or computer or phone you got to pay to play prices are too high for some stuff but they do that so if you have to buy to be able to build City you want.

But one thing I've noticed is that as you progress and as you build more buildings, it gets harder to renovate and to edit your city and it takes so much time to move all your buildings by holding it one by one and moving it all to the corner just to insert an another building. It'd be better if you'll add a city layout edit where you can store all your buildings & roads at once and place them freely.😅"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.ea.game.simcitymobile_row","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.game.simcitymobile_row&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Pi Music Player - Free Music Player, YouTube Music","description":"🎶With 30 Million+ Downloads🔥 and an overall rating of 4.8 ⭐, Pi Music Player is one of the most accepted and loved Music Players available on the Google Play Store.

I'm a musician and I practice to songs using the app and having to slide the small play-head is annoying because I always go way too far in either direction or start the song over.

Originally I rated it a 5 star but if you guys can make this one thing happen I'll change to a 5.","Switched from the Samsung Galaxy S8 to the 21 Ultra and everything went downhill. On my old phone, this app was absolutely perfect. Repeat, playback, shuffle, skip, everything worked flawlessly. After I switched phones, this app started to suck. Any time I try to play any song from a playlist, it'll skip to one song and only play that one then plays nothing after it ends. If I try to skip, it just goes back to the same song. Please fix this.","Been using this player for about 3 years and was great. I just put it on shuffle all tracks and go. I don't know what happened but it's started adding voicemails and other phone audio (like Samsung files) to my music folder or something. I get notifications from this app like \"file found!\" But can't figure out how to stop it from seeking and adding these nonmusic files. Bad app behavior. I would never opt in to this. Very annoying that I now have to dig around and try to fix this.","My car monitor display has both artist name and album in the artist name section. It used to display only the artist name and I prefer that. I checked the details of the songs and they all have the artist name and album in separate categories. I couldn't seem to find how to revert it back. Anyone else having the same issue? Where's the display settings anyway?","This is one of the best apps I have that not only does its job well. But has mixing features for sound geeks like myself. Simple. Elegant. Works. (My original music player on my phone just does not work at all. And cuts off all music when the screen times out.

Thank you all for your many years of loyalty; we could not have asked for better lords and ladies!","comments":["This game was brilliant, and I had played it for many years, however the \"blacksmith balancing update\" has made the game impossible to play, for anyone who doesn't spend money. I think about half of the players have stopped playing now. What the developers haven't seen, is that if the spenders don't have anyone who doesn't spend to compete with, they won't have to spend as much to get the same rewards, so the game developers wi get less money I hope this change is reverted soon. Thanks.","Decided to play game with friends and family, only to find out moving servers is a total loss (monies already spent and game money in my account) and I would have to start all over. Has been completely disappointing and never a response from games customer support. Don't waste money on this game as can clearly see they do not listen players and have no concern for them. I suggest looking for something more player friendly. Can see how they created empire by stealing from players.","One has to pay too high a price in real dollar$ and game coins for what you're needing to advance while playing this game. I also learned the hard way, that you have very little chance against Ruby players who are unethical bullies, whether they are players and/or Alliances. There's no recourse when players and Alliances do not follow the rules of the game. Also, why can't you play the game without downloading the updates?","After I updated the game it was demanding update again. so I deleted and installed the app to get rid of the bug. Since I couldn't remember my password I requested a password change but I noticed the game server is also changed and my progress is gone. The game can also be laggy most of the times. It is a good old game but not suitable for modern times and it has very bad bugs. most of players are inactive.","It's a good game overall, except when ever the game has it's bugs... Which seems to happen A LOT.... But what surprised me the most, was that this company gave me my money back. This review used to be vary different, I complained about losing money by buying some stuff and not getting it... Know I'm leaving my review with 4 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"air.com.goodgamestudios.empirefourkingdoms","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.goodgamestudios.empirefourkingdoms&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Wikipedia","description":"The best Wikipedia experience on your Mobile device.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Army Men Strike: Toy Wars","description":"Play like a kid, fight like a man in a war without limits!

You buy the packs and so much of what you buy you never get. Fun game, but \"free play\" sadly isn't much fun as you can't compete and always lose everything when you can't afford shields.","This is a pay to win game. No matter how many free events there are you never going to get what is offered to people who pay. There are people with all over a billion power they will farm you. If you can't be on the game daily even free events aren't going to help. Plan to play for 3 years before you can compete and by then they will be even stronger. Maybe if you had just start up battlefields.","Tell you what, I watched the gameplay of this and I was sold! It looks like toystory meets call of duty!! I downloaded it instantly, looks great!!! Ill give It 5 stars until further notice. Remember, Xbox and Playstation controllers can connect to your android device, so you don't need the touch screen to play! Anymore :D","Well, I saw this game on an ad and I though \"Hey this looks interesting\" but when I actually installed it, it was NOTHING like the ad, it was one of those territory games, but the thing in the ad said that it was a Third Person shooter game like COD or Fortnite, but no it wasn't, talk about a rip-off. Anyways, it was a complete waste of time.","The game takes some time getting used to, however 9/10 times you're going to get attacked by someone three times stronger than you (most likely pays to win), so understanding how to get aegis and leveling up is paramount.

It'll automatically delete them even if you regularly use the app, after a certain period of time even though it's not supposed to. Do you know how long it takes to re-download movies? It takes much longer than the 1st time!! Fix this ridiculous issue and I'll give 5*","I'm not happy with the program changing it's format. The \"Continue watching\" seems to have been removed, A few days ago, I couldn't find any of the shows and movies that I spent a large sum of money on building up my Library. Due to the fact I watch my movies daily, it was clear I didn,t cause that glitch. When I tried the next day, they were back. They really need to quit tweeking the sight. They change everything from the Logo on up.","Aside from being able to watch movies and shows, it excutes everything poorly. They removed the \"contiwatching\" so if you are watching a show and exit out of the app, you have to scroll all the way back to the show all the way back to the episode. The app has problems not being able to watch some movies and you have to clear out cache just to get it to work. Google proves that it is trying to ruin literally all their apps.","What I like: Found a show that I can't get on dvd. What I don't like: I always download what I buy for offline viewing. Every so often, my downloads mysteriously stop working and I have to remove them and redownload. It happens enough that I will never buy anything else for Google TV. Also, at least one show that I bought has a part of the episode missing. I downloaded it with an excellent wi-fi connection, so that wasn't the issue.","The volume problems are obnoxious. The volume is so low on every video you have to turn the TV up all the way and it still isn't loud enough. You also can only control the volume half the time. The rest of the time you get some dumb error about surround sound being enabled. No other streaming service has this problem.

Just the directions alone with voice navigation , and more detail like traffic or construction , etc Which is a constant here in Houston. I love that it is lighter than Google Maps and does not need a speedy WiFi connection and it doesn't eat up your memory. You can also get phone numbers and more pertinent information much quicker and easier in this app. My favorite part is the discovery of new places.","My Pixel 3a is starting to show its age unfortunately, and with that the main app makes my phone extremely laggy and causes other background apps to freeze or crash. Go on my phone acts as if the app isn't even running! Also something that is worth mentioning that will make me a perma user of this app, even on a brand new phone, is the fact that navigation and the map are two separate app instances. You can navigate the map and keep navigation open individually. No more accidental closures!!","One of the best apps especially for my Nexus 5 , low memory... However, I have notice a couple months ago after the recent update (from v144 to 152) the green android icon appeared on Drawer also home screen and not the ORIGINAL Google Maps Go icon even though I clear cache or reset the phone...can you fix this please? Thanks","Very slow, No metro of Athens routes, just showing busses. Slow to the point you pass the turn and the app is still to show current position. Unpacked my Garmin again. Have to curry two devices but atleast I won't waste my time driving in circles or second guessing. Google, you practically destroyed a good app. Don't even try walking with it.. it will break your nerves! In Athens it became totally useless","I never get lost as Google Map tells me where to go ,great app easy to use ,no need to buy those expensive ones when you can have it on your phone ,Been to alot of places where I've never been and all good ,,even tells you if a speed trap is ahead not that I'm speeding of cause"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.mapslite","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.mapslite&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"TuneIn Radio: News, Sports & Online Music Stations","description":"FROM NOW ON, THIS IS RADIO.\r\n\r\nTuneIn brings together live news, sports, music, podcasts and radio stations from around the world.\r\n\r\nWith live and on-demand audio from the voices you trust, on any device, you're never without something amazing to listen to.\r\n\r\nALL YOUR AUDIO IN ONE APP.\r\n\r\n• News: Listen to and stay informed with live 24/7 news from local, national and global news sources, including CNBC, CNN, MSNBC, FOX News Radio, NPR and BBC.\r\n\r\n• Sports:  Listen to live NFL, NHL, and college games, anywhere you go, plus local, national, and global sports talk stations.

For technical help, please email appstore@tunein.com.","comments":["Pretty good app overall, but one major negative is that it loses connection a lot and every time I hit pause, even if it's just for a few seconds, the app makes me listen to a 30 second ad! Very, very very annoying when I'm listening to a live sports game! Please stop being so greedy and fix this issue! Put like a 5 minute grace period in or something reasonable.","Enjoy this application for many years now. However, recently I am having issues with the sleep timer on my favorite radio station. Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","It's a good app, you can access 1000s of stations but one of the joys that made it similar to listening to a real live radio was the sleep timer feature. It's not working on the current version for some reason which is a shame and a pain. Not an issue if listening during the day, I would imagine though.","App often goes into endless cycle of ads and doesn't return to radio station I'm listening to. I understand having ads when I'm not paying for subscription but I just listened to 20 minutes of ads and had to turn off because it won't return to radio station I was listening to. Have to close, reopen, listen to more ads then back to station. And then when radio station returns from its own commercial break TuneIn will suddenly cut to its own ads & begins endless cycle of ads w/o return to station."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"tunein.player","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Block City Wars: Pixel Shooter with Battle Royale","description":"5..4..3..2..1..

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

I recommend it. I edit all types of videos on it and the result is good. Ps:Video Layer for example when I make a reaction I want to film myself on camera then I want to put video over video plus why he took that phase where the sound is from, that is, where it comes from, it's harder that way where it comes from I hope to solve these problems.","4 stars because it not easy to use for a novice like me. Learning curve is a bit of a challenge with some feature options without explanations attached. Have to watch a number of videos to learn how to use. Its a good product but takes a bit of practice and lots of mistakes for a beginner with little knowledge and experience to make a good video. Will like it better when i get the hang of it. Quality product without a doubt. To Power Director team: Consider apps ease of use for novices. Thanks.","Tried it and it looks just like something I've been looking for, but to get much out of this, you have to pay. This is a demo, not a fully functioning app. The prices don't seem outrageous, but the description of this app should clearly state somewhere that it's a demo. The app developers should offer this as a paid app with all basic functions enabled forever if you buy it. This \"subscription\" stuff is disingenuous app nonsense. Seems very intuitive but I thought this was more than a demo."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.cyberlink.powerdirector.DRA140225_01","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyberlink.powerdirector.DRA140225_01&hl=en&gl=us"}]
