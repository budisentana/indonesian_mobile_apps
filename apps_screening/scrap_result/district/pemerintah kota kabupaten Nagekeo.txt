I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static. Still, it's great for people who use wired headphones. I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","The app work fine but when you quit an app it's notification keeps persistent for a couple of seconds. The app doesn't look very modern, it looks like it's from 2010. The app keep removing the names of radio stations I saved. So please fix it. Moreover this app doesn't support Android 11 media controls.","This app came preinstalled with my phone and is one of the few that I haven't tried to remove. It doesn't require an internet connection and so is the perfect go to entertainment when I have no mobile data. The sound quality is as good as any radio, with the convenience of having it on your mobile device. There are no in app purchases to unlock stations or premium features. It's the only radio I need.","Everything just works. Simple layout, doesn't need an internet connection and has useful features like recording.

It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!!

Put like a 5 minute grace period in or something reasonable.","Enjoy this application for many years now. However, recently I am having issues with the sleep timer on my favorite radio station. Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","It's a good app, you can access 1000s of stations but one of the joys that made it similar to listening to a real live radio was the sleep timer feature. It's not working on the current version for some reason which is a shame and a pain. Not an issue if listening during the day, I would imagine though.","App often goes into endless cycle of ads and doesn't return to radio station I'm listening to. I understand having ads when I'm not paying for subscription but I just listened to 20 minutes of ads and had to turn off because it won't return to radio station I was listening to. Have to close, reopen, listen to more ads then back to station. And then when radio station returns from its own commercial break TuneIn will suddenly cut to its own ads & begins endless cycle of ads w/o return to station."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"tunein.player","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GPS Phone Tracker & Mileage Tracker","description":"GPS Does It All\r\nThis handy, easy-to-use app leverages the latest GPS technology to help you track safe driving behavior, and all of your trips.","descriptionHTML":"GPS Does It All<br>This handy, easy-to-use app leverages the latest GPS technology to help you track safe driving behavior, and all of your trips.","summary":"Use this GPS tracker to keep tabs on driving behavior and mileage","installs":"10,000,000+","minInstalls":10000000,"maxInstalls":39681813,"score":4.230014,"scoreText":"4.2","ratings":302167,"reviews":94037,"histogram":{"1":33677,"2":7043,"3":17163,"4":42498,"5":201784},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$1.49 - $69.99 per item","size":"54M","androidVersion":"8.0","androidVersionText":"8.0 and up","developer":"Family Safety Production","developerId":"Family+Safety+Production","developerEmail":"feedback@lready.org","developerWebsite":"http://www.lready.org","developerAddress":"539 Bryant St\nSuite 402\nSan Francisco CA","privacyPolicy":"http://www.lready.org/privacy_policy","developerInternalID":"5134828142906792899","genre":"Social","genreId":"SOCIAL","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aQjc-kwhYpjCIHKblJQg4nHsVu6rcv9Yhon-zqqvUJftFIgBxUOwLePITcO_w8iefQ","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WZdtOpMJFXAOMJuKsGi3dhchRj55xRIIQaro3wI8DeDUyJ2VdeeaA8JJkvG2y9OM5baK","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/z6vNZWKj7JYf7OW0dhcRUfaH6KYZg-3R8B1QfCNNZxZbV39vcnc_u2mPWMBsHqFpPw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/usXJZ1xHUFzL04UJpkbRdar5zQ8f0eBKAdcdQ2nZC5BqAk6uA_XE4gW3X2hgFx5Zpw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/E-teM3aWtGFKyQabUQQIsbVNo4Ur5yishrwzcaIkBViLE8FjiRfQj_DP05GbBp_Jr0Q","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ls-IdgpTO_4El1lBfamMLD8qCT9_IDoTHcS6NgBndceY-iMZYzIgin_heuAjsRDYtFk"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Apr 7, 2010","updated":1616190303000,"version":"21.3.1","recentChanges":"- Bug fixes &amp; location improvements","comments":["This app was great in the beginning.

A complete charged battery (4750mAh) drains off within 6 hours. Didn't have this problem before. For this reason I give only two stars. Solve the problem and I will rate it with five stars 😉 Update 26th July 2021: It looks like the issue is fixed. 5 stars for a top app!","Doesn't have the most popular radio stations this it's not really a radio app, it's a BS app. Uninstalled. One-starred. Laughed about non-app. Middle finger to the screen. Telling every single person I speak with, stranger or acquaintance that Simple Radio sucks, even if the conversation is completely unrelated. I will say this to every single person I interact with. If I meet someone new that'll be the first thing I tell them. I have never done this with any app. It sucks that much.","Love this app, I use it all the time! However there is one problem :^: .... My station (particularly the Jazz Radio station in Lyon Rhode Alps in France keeps cutting out, even though it says it's playing. If I try to pause and play it again, the whole app shuts down. Please fix it, I really love this app and my jazz 🙏 Edit: fixed!!! Thank you!!","I've enjoyed using it..... For the first month I had it. Been using it for almost a year and I'm getting real tired of the random closing. I'll be listening to the radio and I'll have a 4 or 5 bar signal and my station stops. So I have to unlock my phone and restart the station to continue listening. I listen to talk radio a lot so I get to miss out on important talks because of random closures. And the app has been patched many times and it still does it. So obviously it isn't a priority.","AGAIN: STATION loses connection. UPDATE: HAPPENING AGAIN!! STILL STOPPING! WHEN GOING TO FIX?

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

These were easy enough to ignore. Recently it's just gotten out of control, with ads in the file system, ads before you can use the other features, and in the past couple days, it's opening ads in my browser. This is unacceptable. If I had the money I would get a new phone just to be free of this app.","Every time it auto pops clean With every cleaning, there is a series of junk advertisements Accidentally, you click and it goes on website Plus you can not delete it. Force stop creates additional trouble ... It always pops up again. It is mandatory extortion. I have 3 Alcatel pieces, 2 tablets and a phone. All are creating problems. I am installing new Android and will never ever vouch for Alcatel again. I had been one of the biggest Alcatel fan, but this has killed it all. Pl stop cleaner","Starting to get ad spam. Annoying as heck. Phone goes off each time I use it to clean ad junk. Sick of the spam. Can't uninstall or force stop on this stupid app. Keeps resetting to restart. I sent screenshot and email. Will update on how support handled this complaint.","I would have put nil for this rateing but it does a good job.BUT they keep on shoving this cleaning ad. for phone and its near impossible to get rid unless you do what they want and go to play store to see there app.nearly forgot the games ads.dont know what is worse.","I never take the time to leave bad reviwes however pissed I get at an app... But I had to do this. First, why are you trying so hard to force me to use your cleaner app? This app for fike managing, get your game together, I don't want it. I should be able to at least decide not to use the functionality. Second, stop putting ads on the app everywhere.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much!

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income.

It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly.

The developer(s) haven't responded to any posts and haven't updated the app in years. This clearly shows that they don't care about the app anymore and won't bother fixing it. This is quite disappointing and definitely a bummer as it's the only offline radio app that I could find.","First of all, I grew up in the Era of radio, but I do wish this application supported wireless earbuds, since the world is moving in that direction, not a problem or a compliant, just something to consider, okay, in your next update. But otherwise, I have no complaints, you could have it in case someone is not interested in using wired earbuds or not.","Works well as an FM tuner. Will ask you about giving location through GPS, don't agree, will also ask you about postal code. Choose other as the option, to get access to the basic FM tuner. [Not sure but I don't think it supports AM radio]. You will need some sort of auditory wire to listen as that is the antennae. Reason being, if there is no antennae you cannot pick up the radio waves. Overall works decent, and results may vary simply depending on the area and proximity to stations.","Who tested this app before release? I'm getting \"Network unavailable.\" and \"Try Again\" is my only option. No way to close the dialog. Really? Try again only fails, so it's an endless loop. I clearly have network access because I downloaded this poorly written app.","App tells me the s10 chip is not activated and I should get my carrier to activate it. My carrier says they have no way to do that. Samsung says they can't do it either. Everyone is pointing the finger at everyone else. Since they won't take charge, how about next radio reaching out to help solve this. I bet they can get to samsung engineers better than I can!

I have made two custom characters, but I can only get one to appear at a time. one will appear, but when i edit the other one so it appears as well the first one vanishes, and can't be found under the stop sign menu. in addition, there are a lot, and i mean a lot of in app purchases, and there is almost nothing for free to play users.","Toca world is an Amazing game! It is full of imagination and creativity. It is a good game for children about the age 6-11. I have played Toca games for about 5 years now and I'm still not bored of it. For a start, when I first played Toca games I loved them! And so when Toca World came out I wanted to play it so bad because all the games were mixed together. For the positives, It doesn't have many ads at all. For the Negatives, you have to pay to expand your world which isn't much of a problem.","I love this app! And the new stuff! But this review Is not mine but is gonna be for my friend. She made a schoolhouse last night or something, Next day (which is today) everything disappeared... Some stuff are not available to get anymore :(. Like she lost the backpack from the gift which is not available anymore (I think?) I really wanna help her out but I dont know how. Soooooo the only way to fix this was telling it in a review! I dont know how you can help but... This was worth it ^_^","There are few complaints I need to make sure get patched. 1, I make 2 characters in the creator. As soon as I go to the floogle place, it only gives me only one character. 2. I put things on the walls, few seconds later it disappears also with other things it happens. Also, it won't let me open boxes. It's annoying because it's with my friend aswell.","I love this app and others do love it to but the only problem is, (why its only 4 stars) is it takes so long to load in the game for me, I have a samsung galaxy if that helps please make it load faster if you can and maybe add more houses?

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"DINO HUNTER: DEADLY SHORES","description":"Hunt or be hunted!

But one thing is I spent $15 dollars on this game, AND I NEVER GOT MY REWARDS. I bought the beginners pack, it failed the transaction but I still got charged. So I tried again not thinking that much of it, and it failed and charged me again. I also bought 150 gold, and the same thing happened!","Well over it's a fun game but I'm absolutely frustrated with the controls you can't edit them at all. And I find myself hitting the reload button instead of firing. Everything is clustered together and you can't swap between left and right handed. I'm right handed but I play better on mobile games with a lefty setup. Make and options to customize controls and I'll rate if 4 to 5 starts.","This has to be one of the best hunting games I have ever seen. This is actually the first game I played when I was young and the first YouTube videos i have ever watched. Nice graphics and all however i wished there could be more dinoes as in the last few maps its the same dinosaurs over and over, and maybe we can move around the map so we have a better chance of winning the trophy hunts, cus their sooooooooo hard","I've already spent 25 dollars and nothing happened, then when I try to see if I can just try again to get it, it says I already own it but still charges me the money for the two other times I tried to buy the starter pack. This app is literally just a scam, there are no words that I can say about this app that will not show how bad it really is.","The graphics are excellent and all except for one bug I incountered. I was in region 10 and was doing a mission to kill 3 Utahraptors and when I killed 2, I waited for another one and somehow, the raptor killed me even though it wasn't there. So fix this bug. I still rate it 5 stars☆☆☆☆☆"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.glu.dino","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glu.dino&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Android Auto","description":"Android Auto is your smart driving companion that helps you stay focused, connected, and entertained with the Google Assistant.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going. They need to fix that but is something I could live with it. Using Google pixel 5","I've read through your support forums. Can't find answers. Issue started Aug 2nd. All features work except sms. Running android 10. When not connected to car google assistant able to read texts. When connected to android auto I can text people but when I get a reply it shows on car's screen but when I press steering wheel button google assistant says 'there aren't any new messages that I can read.'

Best part is that you dont have to upgrade your bot really to beat the boss, maybe just one or two. Also, no need to really purchase anything, just do good combos. The only bad thing is that you have to get google play so if you delete it you dont have any progress, make sure you save the progress!! To help you if you have trouble winning, purchase these robots: UWI Ambush UWII Six Shooter WRB I Gridlock WRB Albino WRB- Metro Gold","Overall, this is a good game. But, I bought a bunch of stuff on my iPhone, and logged into Facebook hoping to transfer my games data over to my Android phone, only it find out that none of it transfers across phones, but I can still log into Facebook. This is a little more than anoying, and if there's a way to fix the problem, this is an easy 5 star game.","I'll start by saying that a few days ago this would've been 4 starts as it's a fun game but the energy system slows it down. Today I got on and the game told me I hadn't beaten UWI yet? How? I have two WRBII robots and I was getting ready to fight Zues. So I though eh whatever I'll play through it really quick. So I equipped my old UWI robot and tried to go through the championship again. I beat UWI logged on the next day and the progress was gone once again. I still have all my robots and stuf","OK, all I can say is 'OUTSTANDING' with brilliant gameplay, astonishing graphics and gorgeous mechanics of the game itself. This one's better than the boxing champions I'm telling you. Gives me back many nostalgia! Playing since 2013 (it's first release) and I see there's alot changes now that really improved the game and impressed me, the mystery draw was a great thing coz you can win alot of unique robots like Zeus, Atom, Cosmobot and more! Good job reliance!","This game I'm played in 2016..all the stages completed..after I deleted the game..now in 2021. Again I downloaded and started playing..but I don't know there is a small problem I'm facing..3rd of August 21 massage I can see device blocked...why I can't understand...my all the ability cards and transform cards gone...what is this new problem??"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jumpgames.rswrb","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jumpgames.rswrb&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"DC Legends: Fight Superheroes","description":"Recruit Justice League Legends like Batman, Superman, The Flash, Wonder Woman, The Joker, Harley Quinn and many more in the ultimate DC superhero fighting game!\r\n\r\nAs the shadow of the Blackest Night prophecy falls on every world, sheer willpower alone cannot save the shattered DC Universe.

The different game modes are awesome, and the reward system is generous. The Hero/Villain Roster is amazing! I was playing SW:GOH, for years and the developers ended up ruining the game over the years. They focused more on making money rather than keeping it fun. The rewards became very slim. But, if this games stays the way it is with great reward drops, and fairly priced in-game purchases, I'll play this game everyday, and I'll gladly recommend it to everyone I can.","Amazing game. Is not a money grab like the avengers game. It be cool if they can bring some new cools updates. Such as Allowing to invite random people to an alliance. Able to join a random alliance. Heroic mode cost a lot of energy so there a limit of how much you can play. Overall is an amazing game. But the game might need more funding and cool features to get more players Still derseve 5 starts","Been playing for 4 years or more daily (absolutely love it). Best mobile game to date. Very in depth rpg system. Every battle can be different with tons of different play styles. We'll over a 100 characters maybe even nearing 200 now. You can play this game daily for 10 minutes or a few hours to get daily challenges it's all up to you. Or you can play in few minute increments if your a busy worker. Not pay to win, paying only helps you boost a little faster but not necessary. Favorite game!","Great game, especially for beginners, but the grind is made too long and most characters become useful only after certain Legendary Skills have been unlocked, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money very early on you won't have these abilities that make most characters good, also energy goes way too fast, and instead of having a node be playable without recharging it 3 times make it 5, a too hardcore grind right off the bat will make some players quit the game","I've been playing faithfully for three years, got all the characters, was really strong, then they go and add one character (Black Flash) that makes it where you can't do anything and die every single time. It was great until they added that character. TONE DOWN BLACK FLASH SO WE CAN DO PLAY INSTEAD OF ALL CHARACTERS BEING DEFEATED BEFORE WE CAN EVEN DO ONE ATTACK!!!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.wb.goog.dc.legends","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.dc.legends&hl=en&gl=us"}]
