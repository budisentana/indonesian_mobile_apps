Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness.

It will do the job but make you hate yourself for it. The interface is very heavy feeling and at times a pain to navigate. Its like trying to take a detour with no signs. They have catagories... sorta, but I am convinced it was just a program vomiting content after a night of cheap liquor. It has the vibe of a designed team that remember their assignment 3 hours before the deadline. Bring a GPS you're going to need it to find your way around.","More adds than video content. Often the videos fail, but don't worry the advertisements never do. If you try to rewatch a 10 second clip that recently failed, you'll have to watch the advertisement again, which never fails to run. Unacceptable for a company as large as it is, and owned by Disney. Get it together boys and girls....You should be better than this. I pay a monthly subscription for this, rediculous!","Incredibly terrible app for this size company. Load times are awful, there are 30 second unskippable commercials that freeze, so you wait 2 minutes to watch 25 seconds of content followed by more commercials. The watch app is terrible, I have espn+ membership but I'm unable to watch games that are on broadcast television like ABC, because I don't have a cable membership. Their watch section is laid out terribly and it's vague what you are able to watch with your membership. So bad.","If it weren't a dang monopoly, I would've deleted this app years ago. Slow load times, has no problem loading 40 second ads, but then won't load the 10 second highlight you came to see. But wait, try to find the highlight anywhere else, and it'll kick you back to their app. Please, for the love of God, can yahoo, or fox sports, or literally anyone make a half decent app for sports. I'll take it over this dumpster fire any day","Horrible lag in the app. Also it does a horrendous job playing videos. The big issue is the handoff from ad to content. And even when the video is playing, of you change the time on the video, it won't respond and will skip the video. Would have expected a lot more from a big company, bit the app has bee.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone.

Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer.

It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask?

Secondly the car is the weak spot, back then you had to target the soft spot to destroy a car wich was challenging now its brainless and needs no effort. Back then I would have given this a 5 star now I would give it 0 it is now pay to win its sad to say because I loved this game","Absolutely loving the game, very entertaining... except, what happened the all the players? The chat thread is empty, I'm seeing nothing but bots (ai enemies) in all my matches, and I can't seem to catch any players in a match... did I do something wrong? Please help me. Edit: I was just running my daily tasks, and I THINK I found a player... idk, I'm beginning to think the game died lol","It's a great and entertaining game for certain but my account was lost due to me signing someone else's google play account out.Now I've lost everything, please fix this.I will ensure to rate five stars if this issue is solved.","For me the upgrades are way to expensive because before I could get everything only with coins and now everything costs these blue coins. The upgrades are way to expensive one upgrade costs 179 blue coins I could buy a new weapon with 179 blue coins","this is a cool game I like the way like a battle royal or something I like when you can make your own car I really like it you should try it ima keep playing so I can keep getting level up"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.blockycars.online","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockycars.online&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GO Music - Offline & online music, free MV, MP3","description":"Enjoy online & offline music streaming of millions of trending songs on demand.

","comments":["Its a great game, and i would give it 5 stars, however, its is incredibly hard to accumulate gems if you dont have a membership. An idea as how to get more gems faster is to allow the players to sell unwanted dragon eggs, the rarer the egg the more gems you get. You could either take them to Johanns shop or sell them to other players. Another problem is that the game expansions cost so much, and if you dont grind gems and have a membership, you cant play. Other than that, its a great game.","Awesome game, Love the new event, however there are still issues such as not being able to login at times, glitches and bugs within game, animation/model bugs and loading screen bugs. I would love it if SOD fixed these before doing anything else with the game. Also there really isnt much to do after all the quests are done. Very nice game though I love it just need these bugs to be fixed.","I love this game so much. In my opinion, best game ever. But there is some glitches in the game. For example, when I try to get on armorwing island I just get stuck on the loading page forever and ever. That prevents me from finishing my quest. I have been trying everything to get on armorwing island, but nothing has worked. So maybe that can be one of the glitches, fixed in this game","Okay wow, this event has been a disaster. It keeps people from logging in, valkas sanctuary and now the quest board isn't working. Which for most people, is the main way to get notes. So far the only thing done is extending the event, but if it takes them a couple days to fix the board then that's going to affect us a lot. Seriously should of gone with an expansion pack.","It's honestly a great game. The only thing I'm complaining about is the fact that the only way to expand your adventure is by buying membership or paying ton of Money/Gems. I feel like that's ridiculous. And ever since 'SummerHildr ' or Whatnot event came, I've been having bugs and I can't even play my character. Was really looking forward to getting one of the nightlights. But the game decided, No. Really bugs me."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.KnowledgeAdventure.SchoolOfDragons","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KnowledgeAdventure.SchoolOfDragons&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Fire Engine Simulator","description":"FES: Fire Engine Simulator\r\n\r\nMany different fire trucks are waiting for you.

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"YouTube Kids","description":"A video app made just for kids\r\nYouTube Kids was created to give kids a more contained environment filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness.

Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Real Steel Boxing Champions","description":"Build your Robot Fighting in this ultimate action and sports adventure.

I love the concept of being able to customize I've played this game for years and I've been on and off with it. I had the game downloaded about two years ago and had no problems. But now in 2021 whenever I try to play the game freezes and I cant do anything except the info button and once I restart it, it says my profile has been banned for unauthorized activity even tho I havent played the game in years. Plz help😐","It's a good game, the reason why I'm giving this a 3-star is because I have a lot of problem since I was playing this game, sometimes when I fight the enemies once I drop their hp to 0, they still stay alive, and my other problem is it's hard to get rewards, I would suggest increasing the drop rate after winning the game, my third problem is the energy cores, it takes too long to recharge them back again, that's all.","Good game all around and though I do prefer the original version for sure this is quite the upgrade in terms of origins for the bot, also while I do find some of the items can be extremely expensive there are often ways to counteract this such as with the upgrading parts to silver gold etc: the solution I found was to do sparring matches on pro every time I got 5 energy cores until I had enough cash. This is still an amazing game, thanks alot","Really enjoyed playing this game... Loved the ability to make your own robot from a wide range of parts, moves and designs. Just one thing though, when my screen doesn't show attack effects, like the sparks and hit effects, does it have to do with my phone or the fact that it is an android one?","I love this game but it is a little hard the the beginning the ai is tough and you can only fo five fights until it recharges but once you reach pvp it gets a lot easier cause you get things called cores for robots and another currence and you can sometimes get enough cores to get an elemental part which is only like 150 cores which are not hard to get."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.reliancegames.rschampions","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reliancegames.rschampions&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Raft Survival: Ocean Nomad - Simulator","description":"Ocean Nomad is a new release in the series of ocean survival games with new enemies, items, rpg elements, survival on an island and ocean exploration on a boat.

I think the light fury shouldn't be apart of the dragon rider bundle but if so. People who have been one for a year or so should get her once they cannot pay. Also. I'd like to have my space in the hanger please. Room for 420 dragons have now gone down to 270. Fix to fairness please. You already have stuff for card packs and all what not.","Edited to say the problem resolved itself for a while, but it's doing the same thing again .. no matter how many times I restart or reset my modem, the game just loads forever and doesn't open. SO disappointed! I love this game, but ever since I updated I can't login. It says let the journey begin and just loads forever. There is nothing wrong with my internet connection and I have ample storage space 😟","This has been my favorite game for ages. There's always something to do and another goal in the game, and even when upgrading things takes longer and longer, it's still progressable and I'm not sitting on a couch waiting forever and a day for something to get done. Also, to the person who complained about the chief dying, his name is Stoick, not Stoic. Please do your research","Hello the developers of Dragons: Rise of Berk. I have some issues with this game and that is when I play it, it sometimes doesn't save my progress. It annoys me very much, I hope you Devs can fix this because this does not only annoy me, but it also is a waste of time. Anyways, great game would've rate 5 stars but honestly it's just an awesome game, what else can I say? Anyways I hope you Devs fix this issue and then I will rate 5 stars. Bye now!","An enjoyable game. Expensive it is. I hope there is a way for the not really rich but hard working & good at saving players, to have the consolation to be able to afford some of those classy, pricey dragons. It is very entertaining to build the village while raising the dragons, & increasing the viking population. Searching for new dragons is never boring. I hope we can have the feature to be able to breed dragons (breed upgrade), cross breed them, & have some very surprising mixed breed coming."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ludia.dragons","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ludia.dragons&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Turbo Dismount™","description":"The legendary crash simulator is now on Google Play!\r\n\r\nPerform death-defying motor stunts, crash into walls, create traffic pile-ups of epic scale - and share the fun!\r\n\r\nTurbo Dismount™ is a kinetic tragedy about Mr. Dismount and the cars who love him.

But it's a really cool game","Completely awesome game, I love the physics and customization. It's a shame that the game seems forgotten because it's last update was in 2019. If the developera ever do come back (please do), it would be awesome to have a level creator of some sort.q","I played this game like 3 years ago and ended up spending $7 on the premium version. I redownloaded it but Im looking and it says I dont have the premium version anymore. Edit: So that was a year ago whenever it first didnt let me access my purchase. But I just downloaded this game again and I have access to it now xD. So um I give it 4 stars","I decided to download the game again after a few years and it's still a great time killer. Plus the in app purchases aren't unreasonable like other games in my opinion. You can get everything in the game + no ads for only 5 bucks which is pretty good.","I have a suggestion. since I have bought all the maps and cars, I have been playing for a long time. I decided there should be a sandbox mode in the game and that you build and create your own map and use your own imagination to set your map up and you can save the map and name what even you like. I hope you guys make a mode and I think it would make the game better and a better place for imaination!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.secretexit.turbodismount","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.secretexit.turbodismount&hl=en&gl=us"}]
