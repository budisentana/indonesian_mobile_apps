I've been using it for several years now & it has been extremely reliable. I can p/u any ph & immediately set up my ph number to it in conjunction with any other numbers being used. I can log in to any computer, pull up my ph number & immediately start using it as well. There are many other features too. Just an all around great app.","I've been using Google Voice for over 5 years (prior to and after the 'merge' with Hangouts). It gives me the freedom to make calls and texts over IP/WiFi or thru my phone plan. If I'm sitting at my computer I can call or answer in my browser. The biggest issue I've had with Voice is its lack of integration with Google Contacts. It maintains its own contact list and will not search my Contacts. Hey Google! Can you add a 'Use Google Contacts' option so Voice can search and sync with Contacts?","Mostly work as intended. One really annoying problems though: when new messages come in, the notification bar blocks the text input field. tapping anywhere on the screen will just make the notification bar last longer. You literally have to stare at the screen and wait for it to disappear to start typing again, until the next new message comes in, wait for another 3 seconds. Please fix this.","I've been using gv for years and right now it's on my Galaxy S20 FE phone. For the past week or two, though, any calls to/from my gv number aren't working right. When someone calls my gv number, I can't hear them and they cannot hear me. The same thing happens when I call them using the gv app to place the call. I uninstalled the app, rebooted my phone and reinstalled the app and gv worked to receive one call - it worked perfectly. But every call afterwards was the same as before: I can't hear the caller and the caller cannot hear me. The same when I place a call. I have also reset the app data and cache and again: it works for one call and then not again.","I've enjoyed Google and the Voice app for quite some time. On June 28 I was prompted to update my Voice app and did so. After that I've been unable to make calls or send texts. This renders the app unusable. Yikes! I gave it three stars because it's been great until now... Any help or ideas on how to fix this are welcome."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.googlevoice","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googlevoice&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GO Music - Offline & online music, free MV, MP3","description":"Enjoy online & offline music streaming of millions of trending songs on demand.

I could search songs, nothing glitched, it was amazing. But eventually, I wasn't and still aren't able to search songs. The first page it opens when you click on the app, says that the service is offline. And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Pandora - Streaming Music, Radio & Podcasts","description":"Listen to songs hand-picked by some of the top athletes in the world on UNINTERRUPTED Radio.

I can now give it my hearty recommendation again. It has an excellent selection regardless of your taste in music, and the sound quality is excellent. If you have a good, or unlimited, data plan, you can relegate your personal collection to backup status.","I used to have a positive experiencewith Pandora but once i found SPOTIFY it totally changed my life, i have found so many new artists on spotify full albums no problem, and now that i am trying to cancel Pandora, its impossible, they just keep taking my 5.99 every month, customer service good luck trying to find anybody?????? Try SPOTIFY beforeyou ever try this app😡😠😡😠😡","Instead of us troubleshooting, how about you fix it. If everyone is having the same issue connecting to Chromecast, it's your problem not ours. If this doesn't get resolved during my 30 day premium trial, I'll definitely return to Spotify... I suggest everyone reading this comment to do the same! Yes I checked the Pandora community and they all have the same issue. Unfortunately back to Spotify...","Please add ability to reorder stations not only by recent and a-z. I have discovered so many new songs that I love. I miss the comment feature it allowed me to follow people with similar tastes and discover more awesome songs. Please bring that feature back. Also miss the feature that allowed me to scroll thru all the music I played now have to go one by one. Also please bring back 30 sec sample of song. It allowed to listen to songs by same artist if i liked them. Thanks keep up the good work.","I used to love Pandora and pay for offline listening. I've deleted half my stations just to get variety on offline thumbprint radio but once I go offline, I only have the same 3 songs playing. And the variety sucks.

YouTube Music must have every song 🎵 in the world!! And eventually if you hit the like button often enough they will create a list of just your favorite songs/videos. I pay for YouTube premium and I'm sure that's why I don't get any ads at all. I'm very 😊 happy with YouTube Music so far.","This app is alright. I have premium, so I can't comment of the ads. The functions for listening to songs are quite good. However, ocationaly on songs it will say they are from a different artist, or play a song to what it says and what the album cover is. For example, when I went into thefatrat's \"Rise up\" it played a song called solitude instead. This was later fixed, however, if I go to the song, \"Kings and Queens Part two\" by Ava Max, it will sometimes play the wrong song.","The radio option is the only thing I really don't like about it. When you selected \"radio\" on an artist in Google play music it played songs that were from similar artists. YTM however, seems to play songs from artists that you've listened to a lot. Example: Hit the radio button on a power metal artist and the radio starts playing a bunch of TOOL because I've listened to them a lot and it really doesn't fit at all, especially when I'm using it to explore other artists in the power metal genre.","Not fit for purpose. I've been trying to work with this junk since launch. Spent months creating 12 playlists across 12 genres, totalling 9,170 tracks to listen to my playlists across my 7 Google hub max speakers. However, regardless of what playlist you select, even on shuffle, it will always start off playing the first track. It will then continue to play the same 20 or 30 tracks over and over again all day long even when playlist has over 1000 tracks. Switched to Spotify yesterday, heaven!!","I enjoy using the app. It creates several Mixes for you from different genres & eras that you listen to so you can choose what you're in the mood for. Every Wednesday there's a Discover Mix which I love. It's a mix of music they think you'll like based on your music choices. I'd give it 5 stars, but they took away the tab that used to drop down with your task bar. That was great bc you could skip through songs without leaving the app you're currently in.

For technical help, please email appstore@tunein.com.","comments":["Pretty good app overall, but one major negative is that it loses connection a lot and every time I hit pause, even if it's just for a few seconds, the app makes me listen to a 30 second ad! Very, very very annoying when I'm listening to a live sports game! Please stop being so greedy and fix this issue! Put like a 5 minute grace period in or something reasonable.","Enjoy this application for many years now. However, recently I am having issues with the sleep timer on my favorite radio station. Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","App often goes into endless cycle of ads and doesn't return to radio station I'm listening to. I understand having ads when I'm not paying for subscription but I just listened to 20 minutes of ads and had to turn off because it won't return to radio station I was listening to. Have to close, reopen, listen to more ads then back to station. And then when radio station returns from its own commercial break TuneIn will suddenly cut to its own ads & begins endless cycle of ads w/o return to station.","All my favorites have become the same as each other. The last software update broke my favorites. Also need a setting to auto delete downloaded files once listened to. I have to manually delete files when they take up too much space."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"tunein.player","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Free Phone Call App, Free Texting + Calling Number","description":"Dingtone, a free calling app allows you to make unlimited free phone calls, send free text messages to anyone.

Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!!

A complete charged battery (4750mAh) drains off within 6 hours. Didn't have this problem before. For this reason I give only two stars. Solve the problem and I will rate it with five stars 😉 Update 26th July 2021: It looks like the issue is fixed. 5 stars for a top app!","Doesn't have the most popular radio stations this it's not really a radio app, it's a BS app. Uninstalled. One-starred. Laughed about non-app. Middle finger to the screen. Telling every single person I speak with, stranger or acquaintance that Simple Radio sucks, even if the conversation is completely unrelated. I will say this to every single person I interact with. If I meet someone new that'll be the first thing I tell them. I have never done this with any app. It sucks that much.","Love this app, I use it all the time! However there is one problem :^: .... My station (particularly the Jazz Radio station in Lyon Rhode Alps in France keeps cutting out, even though it says it's playing. If I try to pause and play it again, the whole app shuts down. Please fix it, I really love this app and my jazz 🙏 Edit: fixed!!! Thank you!!","I've enjoyed using it..... For the first month I had it. Been using it for almost a year and I'm getting real tired of the random closing. I'll be listening to the radio and I'll have a 4 or 5 bar signal and my station stops. So I have to unlock my phone and restart the station to continue listening. I listen to talk radio a lot so I get to miss out on important talks because of random closures. And the app has been patched many times and it still does it. So obviously it isn't a priority.","AGAIN: STATION loses connection. UPDATE: HAPPENING AGAIN!! STILL STOPPING! WHEN GOING TO FIX? FIRE YOUR AD PERSON. The developer Has REPETITIVELY FAILED to fix the APP & it the app stops multiple times in as short as 15 minutes.. Ads may be necessary in free mode, but if you have to hold your phone to constantly restart, it is not worth ads and doesn't make one feel that the paid version will be stable."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.streema.simpleradio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.streema.simpleradio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Sygic GPS Navigation & Offline Maps","description":"Sygic GPS, Navigation is the world’s most downloaded Offline GPS navigation app, trusted by more than 200 million drivers.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features.

Suscription is axed, this works worse than Google Play Music with an horrible UI. Furthermore it does not integrate into any streaming service and equipment for music outside those few chromecast ones. Quality in sound is well behind other services as well... Is sad to say that the mismanegement of products in Google as of now makes me very suspicious to drop my money on anything google from now on. Sad.","After so many years, can we have some basic playlist editing features like SELECTING MULTIPLE SONGS or SORTING?!?!?!??!!?!?!?!?! These features are so basic that users started asking for them since the start of this sorry excuse you call a product. And great job ignoring us for years. I hope you are proud of yourselves: you took away a perfectly adequate product that is Google Play Music and incompetently gave us this pathetic \"fancy\" replacement with a stupid AI suggesting horrible songs and no adequate functionality to build our own playlists. You should thank the oligopoly that I still allow your undeserving staff to make money off of me. I'm paying mostly to get rid of youtube ads.","Seldom works as promised. If you want to stream random songs this might be fine, but it DOES NOT WORK to play your own music as requested. Completely fails to shuffle playlists: plays the same songs, in the same order, over and over, every time. WARNING - if you use this service to upload your own music files you can NOT get them back, except as unlabeled zip files without folders; they gave me mine as 44 different 2gig files I had to download individually. Crazy! Display of titles is shockingly awful: it often can't fit the whole song title or band name, across various platforms. The inability to select more than one track at a time is absurd and makes manipulating Playlists extremely cumbersome. Works half as well as Pandora but insists on reverting to its own recommendations rather than the requested songs. Functionality with Android Auto is spotty as best: in the car I can't NOT shuffle a playlist, on the TV via AndoirdTV I can only play a playlist in exact order, and using voice commands to my speaker it can't shuffle. Paying for Google1 access to try and fix the bugs was completely pointless, an offensive waste of time and money (\"Have you tried resetting and reinstalling it?\" LOL great support). They kept promising it was going to get better and it just keeps working worse... I've been a Premium member and was a Google Music Play user since day one (and happily would have paid that fee forever!), but now I'm quitting because I'm paying them a monthly fee in order to NOT stream my own music. This has been a horrendous nightmare inflicted on me by those I trusted most with my precious music library, and I don't plan on letting them forget about their failure any time soon. The fact that so many users have been requesting the addition of a Sleep Time for so long-- and it goes ignored-- shows me they just don't care. Most frustrating of all, every single problem I've mentioned was non-existent on the Google Play Music planform before this awful \"upgrade.\" Music lovers should steer far clear of this app if you hope to control your own listening experience.","Just a redirect to YouTube itself, prioritises videos over music. Can't find a browse by album. You're better off using the YouTubeMusic app on your phone and casting to your TV than using this app. At least that way you can browse or find albums/songs/artists you want and control their playback. O, and no background playback, so unlike every other music player app on Android TV (Spotify, Pandora, etc), you can't exit this app and let it run in the background while, say, having your screen saver run. How can Google's own music app on its own platform be worse than third party apps? Or even worse than what they have done before with GPM?! Regression, not progression from Google:(","Terrible experience. Hard to find any content, and if you do get lucky enough to find some content/playlist one day - good luck finding it again on another day, as it seems like it randomly changes what playlists and content is available to you, except for a few of the exact same things that always show up"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.youtube.tvmusic","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube.tvmusic&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"NextRadio Free Live FM Radio","description":"The NextRadio app lets you experience live and local FM radio on your smartphone.

Will ask you about giving location through GPS, don't agree, will also ask you about postal code. Choose other as the option, to get access to the basic FM tuner. [Not sure but I don't think it supports AM radio]. You will need some sort of auditory wire to listen as that is the antennae. Reason being, if there is no antennae you cannot pick up the radio waves. Overall works decent, and results may vary simply depending on the area and proximity to stations.","Who tested this app before release? I'm getting \"Network unavailable.\" and \"Try Again\" is my only option. No way to close the dialog. Really? Try again only fails, so it's an endless loop. I clearly have network access because I downloaded this poorly written app.","App tells me the s10 chip is not activated and I should get my carrier to activate it. My carrier says they have no way to do that. Samsung says they can't do it either. Everyone is pointing the finger at everyone else. Since they won't take charge, how about next radio reaching out to help solve this. I bet they can get to samsung engineers better than I can! Apparently a lot of people have this problem."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.nextradioapp.nextradio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextradioapp.nextradio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"AutoRap by Smule: Record rap over beats w/vocal FX","description":"With AutoRap you always have a platform to share your raps and rhymes.

No dropped calls or calls cutting in and out. Has always been very reliable. I would recommend this as a download if you don't already have it on your phone. I love the spam detection feature a lot as well. Keeps me from doing my \"FBI cyber crimes division\" routine for unwanted calls.","Superb app, but I hate the call recording feature, because it announces that \"This Call Is Now Being Recorded\", to the hearing of the person on the other side, once the record button is pressed. It is particularly embarrassing, when I'm on call with a very respectful person and my cheek mistakenly presses the button, most of them end up terminating the call, querying the reason behind recording the conversation.","Such a worst app which I have ever used. It has poor quality design which doesn't allow to make the things easier. And I can't even record a call without knowing other person who's call I'm recording, Recording announcement is audible to both the people in call, doesn't allow to record conference call. Such a horrible experience by Google. I have been searching for uninstalling this app but I didn't find any way.","Really bad experience with this app. There is no much gestures. Announcing as \"This call is being recorded\" is the worst idea. When someone called and trying to threatening us, we usually record that call. when this will announce we really get into danger. I am trying to use other phone app. Please remove this option. Tell me how to uninstall this app which is default in my phone.","Recently (since latest update?) the app will now crash when I tap the voicemail icon. Sometimes the app will crash just when I try to open it. Running on an LG G7 with Android 9. Problem is not fixed by restarting in safe mode or running a factory reset. Note: The suggestions provided by the developer did not fix the issue.

That is not enough time, and to automatically start charging your Google Play account, I thought this app had a free version. I can't get to the free version. What ever happened to \"try before you buy? Edit: OK, it is possible to kill both\" free trial offer\" screens and try the app, just a lot of ads. I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate.

Unfortunately, I paid for the ad removal.","This app has multiple problems 1. Needs wifi to find current location; why doesn't it use GPS signal 2. System is set to 'Imperial'; but distance is displayed in 'km'. I want to know that I have 1 mile to my next turn instead of 1.6km I paid for this app but not getting the use that I expected. Don't buy this app until these problems are fixed.","Totally disappointed. All I get is adds, can't even get a simple route without continuous adds. Can't drive and close adds at the same time.

Definitely do not want to trust the app. This could be clear from the privacy information in the app, just one needs to go through. Not sure why developer is wanting to send an email, when they could change the information collection on the app. I dont feel comfortable using the app at all.","Takes forever just to load the maps in navigation, takes a long time just to find my location, weather forecast is only for the present time, seems very clunky."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.maps.voice.navigation.traffic.gps.location.route.driving.directions","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maps.voice.navigation.traffic.gps.location.route.driving.directions&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"iHeart: Radio, Music, Podcasts","description":"Your Music, Your Stations, And #1 For Podcasts.

You can't search within a podcast so you have to scroll until you find the one you want and since they are ordered from new to old, if you let it play automatically, it'll play \"in reverse\" (i.e. Part 2 would play before Part 1.) and every now and then, instead of staying the next episode, it'll go back to the top and play the latest.","When it works nothing beats it but lately it is worst than Sirus.....which is bad. Cuts out every half song...then I wait about 5 minutes and some times it comes back but mostly I need to stop the song and restart it. Very frustrating when trying to get a tan on a beach. The web site on the computer is #1.... but the app for the phone is a big ZERO.","I totally love this app!!! It works good, but there are two problems with it. There are too many ads and also I also had trouble for some time keeping the Bluetooth connection when I open the app and play a radio station or podcast or anything on the app. I know there is nothing wrong with me Bluetooth speaker. My speakers are fully charged and I can play everything else on it. Can you please look into it?","I used to enjoy this app more in the beginning but now not so much. I could add and delete songs and it would only play the songs I added. Now you can't delete any songs and it plays random songs not added by me. Also you can't add any Garth Brooks songs. I even tried the free trial for premium and still no luck. I tried to listen to Garth Brooks radio with unlimited skips and I heard one song from him and skipped over 50 times and nothing. I am currently looking into other music options.","Commercials, Commercials, Commercials! If you like Commercials, then this is the app for you. Every time I use the app, I have to FIRST LISTEN TO FIFTEEN COMMERCIALS before I actually get to the station. I upgraded to the plus service, but to no avail. I'm giving it two stars because after you manage to listen to all of the Commercials, it actually does what it should."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller&hl=en&gl=us"}]
