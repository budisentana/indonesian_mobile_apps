Dinilai sukses, E-KTP akhirnya diberlakukan secara nasional, geng.<br><br>Banyak hal yang melatarbelakangi mengapa pemerintah meminta kita pindah ke E-KTP, salah satunya adalah banyaknya temuan kasus KTP ganda yang beredar dan digunakan untuk hal-hal negatif, seperti:<br><br>Menghindari pembayaran pajak;<br>Menyembunyikan identitas diri, contohnya para pelaku kriminal yang masuk ke dalam Daftar Pencarian Orang (DPO);<br>Mengamankan tindakan korupsi atau bentuk kejahatan lainnya.<br>Dengan adanya E-KTP, diharapkan kegelisahan masyarakat bisa mereda karena sekarang semua informasi tersimpan secara digital sehingga susah untuk dimanipulasi.","summary":"how to check your KTP and KK Online 2020","installs":"50,000+","minInstalls":50000,"maxInstalls":83588,"score":3.059406,"scoreText":"3.1","ratings":315,"reviews":176,"histogram":{"1":130,"2":3,"3":21,"4":34,"5":124},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"7.6M","androidVersion":"4.0.3","androidVersionText":"4.0.3 and up","developer":"aziza media","developerId":"aziza+media","developerEmail":"abdul.azis.sip@gmail.com","privacyPolicy":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vjkQ1cMrUBE22PZnhvF6JjVDqLzQklDAJoLRWqJmk14/edit?usp=sharing","developerInternalID":"5483288239222182300","genre":"Books & Reference","genreId":"BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eXUZkIzy2_RFqkYyaQ6yC8n7v4aAE94iDyGoAi0yMrWRA35qTZFlzRT2n5_bWHfmOg","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ld2OYBgrQpy1dMPDqfFzLGbZFEouXtnacxYEIbMJpRGsaEIVNeDXErhzUSchfHDt0Smc","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YCubg6T3vIk_AoBFFD4evBhf8K-gM92rJHkPIbb2p6rbSICa1TTp2fSmV05V3MdfIlA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/etQc3jmRPOY6ledP-bVqV_LmbhmYVDd_Hyk7nwlAlKfL6ojIHQtTlXpttJs5Oj4CmcE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QijHMYPTXFsHxGjanCc_3ZAI61jkcVTo4Smc29fDEV9rstV-ekE_8pt4zniR8JJj2tk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8zmkiao65LEFPUUSdE8pPdFcG0o0xT5IoX8FD3RV2BgAqSB0WLIKq4wDT9GOm4BobCWb"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Jan 6, 2020","updated":1578322252000,"version":"1.0","comments":["Kontol","Aplikasi ga ada guna"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.azizamedia.cara_cek_ktp_dan_kk_online","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azizamedia.cara_cek_ktp_dan_kk_online&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Cek NIK KTP Online","description":"Cek NIK KTP Online - Merupakan aplikasi yang dapat digunakan untuk melihat informasi NIK KTP berdasarkan hasil kodifikasi 16 digit nomor NIK. \r\n\r\nBATASAN: Aplikasi Cek NIK KTP ini,  BUKAN bersumber pada data DisDukCaPil. \r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: APLIKASI INI TIDAK MEWAKILI INSTANSI PEMERINTAH.

So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"HTC Account—Services Sign-in","description":"With HTC Account, sign in to multiple HTC services in one place on your phone.

And then lose, and then have to wait and scrounge all over again until I can play another game of bingo. So thats why no 5 stars.","I'm slightly addicted. Not enough to spend money, but enough to play outside of rewarded play time. I only discovered it through a rewarded play app, trying to win money, not spend it. But, it's a great bingo game. There are many, many fun extras, there's definitely more than meets the eye. There's also a nice variety of ways to earn extra credits but when you're slightly addicted you run through those quickly. All in all, one of the best free bingo apps I've played.","This is my favorite Bingo game. It doesn't get boring but I do think they should give more free chips per day or lower the chips you have to pay per card. I can only play like 3 games per day since I can't afford to spend money on it. I might would spend a few dollars a day if it wasn't so expensive. I think the chips are way to high of a price.","There are so many Bingo apps out that it's hard to choose one. I absolutely love Bingo Bash. (The only other one that is on the same level of fun, for me, is Bingo Pop.) I've leveled up & I'm playing in fun rooms, and contests. My problem is I can never play more than a couple games per day without spending IRL money. Now that I've done that 2x, the prices for a handful of chips soared. I don't win like I did at first either. UPDATE: Since passing level 25, the entire game has changed. 5 stars!","Terrible! You pay for premium cards and still can't win. What a waste! The same people win again and again. The numbers don't make sense that with that many players the same ones win all the time. Also, they need more bingos per game. Is there anything you can buy with all these stupid coins, you should be able to buy bingo chips with them like you can in some other games. The bingos might be randomly called but the SAME PLAYERS keep winning. Even with FOUR PREMIUM cards you can't win."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"air.com.bitrhymes.bingo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.bitrhymes.bingo&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Zenly - Your map, your people","description":"Zenly is a map that lets you know what your friends and family are up to.

I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static. Still, it's great for people who use wired headphones. I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","The app work fine but when you quit an app it's notification keeps persistent for a couple of seconds.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going.

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles. Will update my feedback as I continue using it"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.mapswithme.maps.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en&gl=us"}]
