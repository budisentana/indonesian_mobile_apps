Squashed bugs, fine-tuned the look and feel, and made sure you’re ready to keep binging your favorite content. Download the app today!","comments":["After what seems to be a recent update, it has become extremely tedious to rewatch a TV series. It doesn't properly keep track of what episode you're on where you were at and the episode when you go back to watch it again. It will constantly skip full episodes or restart ones that you were already watching instead of resuming from where you left off.","Hulu, you guys and girls coverage of the 2020 Olympics was horrible! 2 days of speed walking really? Your coverage of the real track and field sports was disgusting! YouTube TV here I come. I understand how television works. A lot of the responsibility falls on the networks shoulders like all of the NBC affiliates but you guys are all friends and have had many, many meetings before the Olympics started. It's pretty bad when the best coverage has been on KGW. That's our FREE local NBC channel!","While I love Hulu and appreciate it as a cord cutter. The app on my TV and here never seems to be able to go back to where I left off in series. It doesn't even start up at the episode I left off. If every other app can do this. HULU should be able to also. It's annoying to have to go back and dig for the season, episode and scene I left of at.","Streaming service is great, but the Android app is awful. I'm watching something where I frequently need to pause to read subs of translated onscreen signs or other text. Touching the screen doesn't pause the video. The pause button is small, and only becomes visible after I click the screen. By the time I hit Pause, the caption is already gone, so I have to back the video up, rinse and repeat.","Frustrated that since the last update every time I exit out or I pause and my screen times out, it starts my show over at the beginning. Then I have to sit and wait for the beginning ad to finish before jumping, to hopefully the right spot. It used to remember where I left off and that has changed. I also noticed that my watch history is all jacked. Sometimes it shows a show I watched a week ago, sometimes it shows an episode like 3 episodes ahead. I'm the only one on my account.

It will do the job but make you hate yourself for it. The interface is very heavy feeling and at times a pain to navigate. Its like trying to take a detour with no signs. They have catagories... sorta, but I am convinced it was just a program vomiting content after a night of cheap liquor. It has the vibe of a designed team that remember their assignment 3 hours before the deadline. Bring a GPS you're going to need it to find your way around.","More adds than video content. Often the videos fail, but don't worry the advertisements never do. If you try to rewatch a 10 second clip that recently failed, you'll have to watch the advertisement again, which never fails to run. Unacceptable for a company as large as it is, and owned by Disney. Get it together boys and girls....You should be better than this. I pay a monthly subscription for this, rediculous!","Incredibly terrible app for this size company. Load times are awful, there are 30 second unskippable commercials that freeze, so you wait 2 minutes to watch 25 seconds of content followed by more commercials. The watch app is terrible, I have espn+ membership but I'm unable to watch games that are on broadcast television like ABC, because I don't have a cable membership. Their watch section is laid out terribly and it's vague what you are able to watch with your membership. So bad.","If it weren't a dang monopoly, I would've deleted this app years ago.

A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness.

Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids\r\n\r\nA safer online experience for kids\r\nWe work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\r\n\r\nCustomize your child’s experience with Parental Controls\r\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\r\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.\r\nBlocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.\r\nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\r\n\r\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\r\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”. \r\n\r\nSelect the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of videos for all kinds of kids\r\nOur library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness.

Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids<br><br><b>A safer online experience for kids</b><br>We work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.<br><br><b>Customize your child’s experience with Parental Controls<br>Limit screen time:</b> Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.<br><b>Keep up with what they watch:</b> Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.<br><b>Blocking:</b> Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.<br><b>Flagging:</b> You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<br><br><b>Create individual experiences as unique as your kids</b><br>Create up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”. <br><br>Select the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.<br><br><b>All kinds of videos for all kinds of kids</b><br>Our library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness.

Can't search the exact content, but pushing many under quality videos, it is like a promoted channel. I tried now several times to edit settings, same result. Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

On top of that the diamond currency is also hard to acquire. Want to try to get items in events? Sorry! Those aren't very f2p friendly either, disappointed.","here are some things I'd like to see in the game: 1. being able to get the materials you want while trading with neighbors: it'd make crafting a lot more easier 2. the recording button 3. a way of leveling up the VIP status apart from the in-app purchases 4. the daily gems earned watching ads 5. the option to change your LinePLAY birthday to your real one 6.","This game is really the best game I played.

Don't need to spend if you know how to use the pop out ads to accumulate free grabs. Doesn't bore on scenery and accessories, but could use a more realistic prize display lineup, maybe a elimination mode and multiplayer mode. Also add some music and some interactive elements please! Great game regardless of the these minor flaws but I'll grab my claws now!!!!!!","This game is exciting and engaging for those who love claw games.In real claw machines,it is very difficult and rare to get a prize.However,the game developers make the game easier for players to collect prizes and even trade for more fun prizes.Lastly,thank you for making this game offline so that I can play it anytime!Keep up the good work!","A bit janky but it's a great time passer. A few issues, like too many coins built up I wish they had a rest on the prizes, also how am I supposed to do the task when the prize isn't there? Like you want me to collect two car prizes but there are no cars to collect? Over all I enjoy this game.","The games okay but you really can't play long enough to make much progress. I stopped playing for a long time because the screen was cluttered with so much on top of machine you where playing. Also 99.99% of the time the ad pop-ups for free energy, grabs, etc... never worked. I came back after almost a year to check it out and I see nothing has changed. It has the potential to be a very relaxing de-stressing game to if they would make some screen improvements and fix the ad pop-ups.","Will change to 5 ☆ if the problem gets fixed... This is an awesome game and brings back many memories playing game's like this at the Arcade. But there are a few glitches interfering with this game... The Joy stick gets stuck and moves on it's own and other screen glitches.

The survivor mode is fun but the wheel of fortune is not balanced in terms of probability, i tend to get more crystals then any other prize on the wheel. But over all its a whell designed game.","This game is epic I love how it is offline because all offline games are soo boring unlike this one.

First of all in the online battle when i ranked in the top 20 i didnt recive any reward..... I waited for quiet some time but still did not recieve anything.

The different game modes are awesome, and the reward system is generous. The Hero/Villain Roster is amazing! I was playing SW:GOH, for years and the developers ended up ruining the game over the years. They focused more on making money rather than keeping it fun. The rewards became very slim. But, if this games stays the way it is with great reward drops, and fairly priced in-game purchases, I'll play this game everyday, and I'll gladly recommend it to everyone I can.","Amazing game. Is not a money grab like the avengers game. It be cool if they can bring some new cools updates. Such as Allowing to invite random people to an alliance. Able to join a random alliance. Heroic mode cost a lot of energy so there a limit of how much you can play. Overall is an amazing game. But the game might need more funding and cool features to get more players Still derseve 5 starts","Been playing for 4 years or more daily (absolutely love it). Best mobile game to date. Very in depth rpg system. Every battle can be different with tons of different play styles. We'll over a 100 characters maybe even nearing 200 now. You can play this game daily for 10 minutes or a few hours to get daily challenges it's all up to you. Or you can play in few minute increments if your a busy worker. Not pay to win, paying only helps you boost a little faster but not necessary. Favorite game!","Great game, especially for beginners, but the grind is made too long and most characters become useful only after certain Legendary Skills have been unlocked, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money very early on you won't have these abilities that make most characters good, also energy goes way too fast, and instead of having a node be playable without recharging it 3 times make it 5, a too hardcore grind right off the bat will make some players quit the game","I've been playing faithfully for three years, got all the characters, was really strong, then they go and add one character (Black Flash) that makes it where you can't do anything and die every single time. It was great until they added that character. TONE DOWN BLACK FLASH SO WE CAN DO PLAY INSTEAD OF ALL CHARACTERS BEING DEFEATED BEFORE WE CAN EVEN DO ONE ATTACK!!!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.wb.goog.dc.legends","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.dc.legends&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GO Music - Offline & online music, free MV, MP3","description":"Enjoy online & offline music streaming of millions of trending songs on demand.

And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Super Mario Run","description":"A new kind of Mario game that you can play with one hand.\r\n\r\nYou control Mario by tapping as he constantly runs forward.

Edit: it's pretty stupid people are complaining about having to pay after 3 levels because a normal Mario game is 60$, I feel it's a lot better than charging 10$ up front because you can have a trial of the game, something most payed mobile games can't say. It is annoying that you have to play on wifi But it's ok","This game is really fun, brings back lots of memories of being a kid so frustrated at a level because I can't beat it. I love it. One complaint is I had finished the game 100% but on my old phone and when I signed in to Nintendo on my new phone it wouldn't transfer my levels completed so I now have to play the entire game again. Not too mad though it gave me a reason to play it again.","It was good but I don't like how you have to pay for the full game as you can't go past level 3 without paying. But altogether it is a fun and all the levels are diverse and will entertain you a lot. Even if you complete all the levels there are always high scores you can beat, coins you can collect, and baddies you can smash! I would recommend this to all ages. Just keep in mind you might need to pay for the full experience.","It's a pretty good game and I really like it. There is multyplayer, story mode and remix 10 which is kind of a invite game mode where you can unlock different stuff. But I only gave 4 stars. And that's for a reason! Because after playing the first World you have to pay atound 10€ which I think is to much for a mobile game especially if it doesn't give that much new content after the purchase.","The game is really fun and I've never had a problem with it. They released new stuff over time to keep it fresh but I'm just now coming back to it so not sure what they are doing currently. I can't believe people have the audacity to complain about the price when so many people put so much more money into \"free\" games. I would much rather pay a fixed price that honestly isn't bad at all; Especially considering it is actually fun and well thought out unlike 99% of the games found in the store."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.nintendo.zara","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zara&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Wikipedia","description":"The best Wikipedia experience on your Mobile device.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Play Games","description":"Games are more fun with the Google Play Games app. We'll help you find your next favorite game – from action to puzzles.

I'm now waiting a month at a time to simply expand my village and that's all I CAN do. I can't buy anything, no room, and if I do I have to wait another 2 weeks to expand so, great game but it gets exhausting waiting to expand all the time because it is so so so so expensive. Would b 5 stars if it weren't for that.","Hi I'm Giving this a two star 🌟 only because now when I play in collecting my coins and stuff and doing what I have to do to level up but once in a few minutes maybe seconds I get ads It will stop and then give me another one and it's just not worth the hassle for me so please explain why I'm getting ads? Or does anyone else gets ads great game I love it just the ads are annoying","Amazing game, but a little bit expensive. Anyways, the only improvement I need is that I want the things I buy to already have their permanent places because moving them is a hassle and I do not like unorganized things so...😬","it's a money pit after around 50 90% of animals you have to use acorns which you have to buy. you only have about 12 toys for the critters to play, decoration is not much better, I think once you buy in the VIP club you get more animals and decorating and toys. all they want is more money . It stopped giving the free acorns. And I lost my game and cannot find it so I had to start over.","I've always loved the game but the constant asking to update with another game found on the cloud is so annoying as it takes you some levels back.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much! Saying that the local news I receive is great and helps keep me up-to-date!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.particlenews.newsbreak","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.particlenews.newsbreak&hl=en&gl=us"}]
