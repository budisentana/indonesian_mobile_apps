Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little. But they slowed the car like WAY too much.","It's an okay game. It would be better though if it didn't give you THE SAME CARS when you use cash for them. The more you get cars the more it happens. Not only that but when you hit an oil tank truck and it blows up you fall through the ground instead of landing back down. The tanks are unnecessarily overpowered they shoot at you and flip you then you get back up and flip again over over until you get wrecked!","This game is very fun, unfortunately, the time amount of time it takes to get arrested varies and the game does glitch.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going.

In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game.","I love this game so much! My sister always play this everyday. Also I was wondering if you can add more characters that look like cartoons or movies games like FNaF and your style.thank you!","The game is useless you can't even get out the respawn area at all u can't even move hardly update ur game so pepole can actually play without any issues remove the ads the game is horrible you can't even get out the respawn area at all u don't even have half the stuff needed for the game it should not be on play store no flints for the tnt and no pickaxe nothing its terrible I do not recommend downloading the game because its useless","So far it's a pretty good game, runs smoothly in multiplayer for me. I have actual minecraft so I usually only play this with a friend who doesn't. Creative mode is pretty good so far but hasn't been updated in ages. Could you add more blocks? For example, stairs, rods, signs, animal spawn eggs, and more. Oh, the ability to place trap doors lower would be a nice addition. Also could it be possible for pressure plates, sticky pistons, honey blocks, and redstone to be added in, in the future?"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"FM Radio","description":"Motorola FM Radio makes it easy to scan for stations, build your favorites list, set your sleep timer, record the best songs, and see live information about what’s playing -- all with a cool Material Design look. \r\n\r\nThis application has been designed to work on Motorola phones with an enabled FM chipset and running Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and above.

I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static. Still, it's great for people who use wired headphones. I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","The app work fine but when you quit an app it's notification keeps persistent for a couple of seconds. The app doesn't look very modern, it looks like it's from 2010. The app keep removing the names of radio stations I saved. So please fix it. Moreover this app doesn't support Android 11 media controls.","This app came preinstalled with my phone and is one of the few that I haven't tried to remove. It doesn't require an internet connection and so is the perfect go to entertainment when I have no mobile data. The sound quality is as good as any radio, with the convenience of having it on your mobile device. There are no in app purchases to unlock stations or premium features. It's the only radio I need.","Everything just works. Simple layout, doesn't need an internet connection and has useful features like recording.

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","First, I'm consistently taken to places that are not there (looking for Ace Hardware in Boulder CO, sent me to Ball industries) 2nd, the initial directions and distance given are vastly different from when you engage the drive aspect of app. My last major issue: Unlike most other nav apps, this one does not display the address of the location you've arrived at, so when I reach a job (I'm an electrician) I have to go back to the text sent by the customer to find the precise location/address.","This app is mostly designed for outside the USA. You fight with getting everything non-metric but then when you route a trip, the distance is again in metric. Plus, what's with the icon? It has that same Google looking confusing blue fan thing trying to indicate what direction you are facing. Is it suppose to be in front of you or behind you??? How about a simple arrow? How hard would that be? It's just as confusing as Google Map's icon. If you are in England or somewhere similar, go ahead and try this. For us American users, it's as useless as a screen door on a submarine and I'm uninstalling with extreme prejudice.","Don't buy this product, it use to be good with good service. I bought it with the premium package with free maps. Then when their new premium combined package comes out, I could not use my sygic navigation in Chicago. Their help was to buy the newer premium package with fewer map renewals. And pay literally the same $40.00. That is out acceptable.","I want to like the app but to me it has two bad short comings. I have trouble seeing the maps because I have bifocals. U am too close to see with the far vision and too far to see with the reading so I need voice. That brings me to the second one. I am not paying 55 bucks a year for voice instructions. I don't want the rest of what comes with a subscription. You should offer voice at a lower price, except you withheld that so people would pay for premium. I also hate the premium nag ad."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GPS Route Finder : Maps Navigation & Directions","description":"GPS Route Finder : Maps Navigation & Directions provides variety of features such as GPS shortest Route finder, Driving route , Current Location, Maps Navigation, GPS Area Calculator, Distance Calculator, International subscriber dialing (ISD) or Country Codes, City Codes (STD) codes(USA, India, Pakistan), Altitude meter & more - make everything simple and easy! \r\n\r\nGPS Route Finder use GPS & Network to get your position on Map, Helps you Navigate Freely on maps and get you required directions.

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently.

I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!! And for the RICHIE RICH PEOPLE out there that loves to spend $$$$$ then go play Mobile Strike Gaming and you'll feel right at Home then tooo!!!!

There are 2 modes, system smash and planet smash. Planet smash has a large variety of things to destroy planets with, and you can create your own planets. System smash only has a few weapons, and its like universe sandbox in a way. A few things I would like to see, are a bit more weapons in the system smash, and a bit more realistic things, like if you melt the polar ice caps the world will flood. Once that is done, this is a 5 star game","It's good, but the 1 thing that really annoye me is I have tried getting the Cube World with the orange laser and the grid, but even though I make the best cube. I don't unlock it. So can you guys please fix it! I think other people around the world are suffering from it and are sad and mad. Its a really satisfying game it never gets you bored.","A fantastic and amazing game. Can't wait to see what other tools you guys come out with. Edit: One of the recent updates made the game not recognize my remove adverts purchase, and it doesn't allow me to make the purchase again. Hope this is fixed some point soon. Solar Smash is still great. Edit edit: Reinstalling seems to have helped. Nevermind.","Have had paid version for a little while, and enjoyed it a lot. But, now with the 3 new weapons, WOW! a LOT better. All 3 are entertaining as all get out. Highly recommend. NOTE: Even tho have paid version, after update (8/2/2021) I had a full screen ad show up. WHAT GIVES??","Extremely realistic graphics, a lot of planets, the new solar system mode is fun, you can modify the damage of some of the weapons, and.. it's a game to play in free time like 30 minutes.

I've been using it for several years now & it has been extremely reliable. I can p/u any ph & immediately set up my ph number to it in conjunction with any other numbers being used. I can log in to any computer, pull up my ph number & immediately start using it as well. There are many other features too. Just an all around great app.","I've been using Google Voice for over 5 years (prior to and after the 'merge' with Hangouts). It gives me the freedom to make calls and texts over IP/WiFi or thru my phone plan. If I'm sitting at my computer I can call or answer in my browser. The biggest issue I've had with Voice is its lack of integration with Google Contacts. It maintains its own contact list and will not search my Contacts. Hey Google! Can you add a 'Use Google Contacts' option so Voice can search and sync with Contacts?","Mostly work as intended. One really annoying problems though: when new messages come in, the notification bar blocks the text input field. tapping anywhere on the screen will just make the notification bar last longer. You literally have to stare at the screen and wait for it to disappear to start typing again, until the next new message comes in, wait for another 3 seconds. Please fix this.","I've been using gv for years and right now it's on my Galaxy S20 FE phone. For the past week or two, though, any calls to/from my gv number aren't working right. When someone calls my gv number, I can't hear them and they cannot hear me. The same thing happens when I call them using the gv app to place the call. I uninstalled the app, rebooted my phone and reinstalled the app and gv worked to receive one call - it worked perfectly. But every call afterwards was the same as before: I can't hear the caller and the caller cannot hear me. The same when I place a call. I have also reset the app data and cache and again: it works for one call and then not again.","I've enjoyed Google and the Voice app for quite some time. On June 28 I was prompted to update my Voice app and did so. After that I've been unable to make calls or send texts. This renders the app unusable. Yikes! I gave it three stars because it's been great until now...

Suggestion is to add trucks like ladder trucks and rescue trucks. Upgrade the fire station into like a headquarters when u have the scanline nova. And, yes, separate button of sirens and lights, default lights should be light bars. And a feature that we can get out the truck whenever we want. And make sure the ladders are useable if u added them, and b4 the ladders rise up, maybe make a feature like us controlling the ladder in the basket. Thx for the new update. 👍","Soo great the game has good graphics and a perfect customization system that is great for a game like this only problem my fire engine cant drive up hills can this please be fixed","Good game just need make it where the cars pull over or stop when you are running lights and sirens","Such a good game but I wish there was a multilayer mode in the next update please other than that a overall great game 👍","I want the game is very funny it is very very very fun the game is already freestuff4u you can you play gameplay more games playing with me then you can do a lot of more stuff you can you know play with other people you know you can be nice as a player you know you can you know you didn't get carded and get damaged it's very fun game these you a lot of free time to do stuff that isn't lot very nice so I think the game free fun a lot of you know you know I'm Realty Lizzie and very good graphics i"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.skisosoft.fes","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skisosoft.fes&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"sand:box","description":"Relax with a particle sandbox that has no adverts.

I love the design identity in resources. Of course, after daily playing this game for a year and a half, I feel the lack of the available resources to play with even after updating to a yearly major update this 2021. But that's okay – this is the only thing that bothers me and I'm waiting for a new update for this game. Awesome antistress, to be honest 😂👍","I love this little game so much! There is so much to do if you just wanna zone out and draw whatever. One tiny bug is that sometimes my brush size if i change it it goes really wonky. I fixed it by uninstalling and reinstalling but if this could be fixed in an update at some point? It isn't the biggest deal though really it's a great little game to just create (or destroy) things with and I highly recommend if you like just talking to yourself or listening to music as there's no ads","Never have I purchased anything this quick on the playstore (and only to add some not really needed options). No ads, only the 1 purchase option. Absolutely 5 stars. So much fun to see the particals falling, settling, floating etc, and of course exploding. Thanks for this wonderful gem of a game/simulator edit: still having fun with this from time to time! Edit2 still fun :)","Really good game, appreciate the absolute lack of ads. There is a few small bugs (if you set petrol/crude oil/nitroglycerin on fire, then explode with uranium, the fire turns into ash), but it works perfectly. Fun game, somehow managed to occupy me for quite awhile. Recommend download even just to try out. No complicated gravity physics, but it doesn't matter, it can run on my potato and that's good","i love it, obly complain i have, is that you removed plant block itvwas cool to play tmwith it, and i see kinda lack of usable resources, you cloud add gold, and some more. but after all its great. edit: you could add an eraser that removes only one type of block at time, so that you can remove, for example, the metal from which you make a mold that is hard not to break the tin figure you made, i apologize for my english"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"smellymoo.sand","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=smellymoo.sand&hl=en&gl=us"}]
