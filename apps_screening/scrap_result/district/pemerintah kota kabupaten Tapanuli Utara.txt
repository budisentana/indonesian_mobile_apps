Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving.

I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static. Still, it's great for people who use wired headphones. I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","The app work fine but when you quit an app it's notification keeps persistent for a couple of seconds. The app doesn't look very modern, it looks like it's from 2010. The app keep removing the names of radio stations I saved. So please fix it.

The sound quality is as good as any radio, with the convenience of having it on your mobile device. There are no in app purchases to unlock stations or premium features.

That is not enough time, and to automatically start charging your Google Play account, I thought this app had a free version. I can't get to the free version. What ever happened to \"try before you buy? Edit: OK, it is possible to kill both\" free trial offer\" screens and try the app, just a lot of ads. I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate. A free trial means you don't need to do anything to use it, including making an effort to subscribe. UPD: sorry, my bad. Didn't notice the X button. The app is great, considering paid subscription."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.apalon.weatherradar.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apalon.weatherradar.free&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Block City Wars: Pixel Shooter with Battle Royale","description":"5..4..3..2..1..

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research.

Secondly the car is the weak spot, back then you had to target the soft spot to destroy a car wich was challenging now its brainless and needs no effort. Back then I would have given this a 5 star now I would give it 0 it is now pay to win its sad to say because I loved this game","Absolutely loving the game, very entertaining... except, what happened the all the players? The chat thread is empty, I'm seeing nothing but bots (ai enemies) in all my matches, and I can't seem to catch any players in a match... did I do something wrong? Please help me. Edit: I was just running my daily tasks, and I THINK I found a player... idk, I'm beginning to think the game died lol","It's a great and entertaining game for certain but my account was lost due to me signing someone else's google play account out.Now I've lost everything, please fix this.I will ensure to rate five stars if this issue is solved.","For me the upgrades are way to expensive because before I could get everything only with coins and now everything costs these blue coins. The upgrades are way to expensive one upgrade costs 179 blue coins I could buy a new weapon with 179 blue coins","this is a cool game I like the way like a battle royal or something I like when you can make your own car I really like it you should try it ima keep playing so I can keep getting level up"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.blockycars.online","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockycars.online&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"File Manager -- Take Command of Your Files Easily","description":"The best File Manager is a powerful file explorer for Android that you can handle all your files and folders, which stored in your internal storage and external storage.

As you have no negative numbers, I cannot rate it. My information and programs are constantly inaccessible. I cannot open files because \" there is no app to open them\". I have rebooted over and over, reset preference to factory settings; the only result is that now my sd card has disappeared. File manager sucks.","Very Good, but not perfect. There is still a few unknown files that just wont go away.","I used this File Manager app on my Alcatel 7 (because it was pre-installed) when the app icon was purple and the app is okay, I mean it's not the best, but I like it. Though the newer versions looks SUS 😒. Other than that there is some versions of this app where it is not sus but I just don't like the look of the UI but it does actually do what it says like make your phone feel faster... sort of. So like I said this app is okay.","The notification wont go away if you try to swip it away, and it wont let me Force stop the app it will keep popping up the notification, and it wont let me delete it it will just make me keep the app and say i have to update it don't get this app it dosen't even work","Really works Well... The only negatives for me is I wish it didn't have the advertisements popping up but being this was a free app I guess you have to take the bad with the good or (is that the good with the bad lol). With other free apps I've used the apps were slammed full of pop up ADs. So comparing this app with those, this app has a lot less ADs. The company has to make money somehow. So to continue to get the app for free I will just have to deal with it. Plus I would rather the ADs pay for it rather then me.

Suggestion is to add trucks like ladder trucks and rescue trucks. Upgrade the fire station into like a headquarters when u have the scanline nova.
