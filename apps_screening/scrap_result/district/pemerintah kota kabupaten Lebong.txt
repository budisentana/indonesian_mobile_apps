However, i have given it 4 stars because of a glitch that i do not know how to fix. I have made two custom characters, but I can only get one to appear at a time. one will appear, but when i edit the other one so it appears as well the first one vanishes, and can't be found under the stop sign menu. in addition, there are a lot, and i mean a lot of in app purchases, and there is almost nothing for free to play users.","Toca world is an Amazing game! It is full of imagination and creativity. It is a good game for children about the age 6-11. I have played Toca games for about 5 years now and I'm still not bored of it. For a start, when I first played Toca games I loved them! And so when Toca World came out I wanted to play it so bad because all the games were mixed together. For the positives, It doesn't have many ads at all. For the Negatives, you have to pay to expand your world which isn't much of a problem.","I love this app! And the new stuff! But this review Is not mine but is gonna be for my friend. She made a schoolhouse last night or something, Next day (which is today) everything disappeared... Some stuff are not available to get anymore :(. Like she lost the backpack from the gift which is not available anymore (I think?) I really wanna help her out but I dont know how. Soooooo the only way to fix this was telling it in a review! I dont know how you can help but... This was worth it ^_^","There are few complaints I need to make sure get patched. 1, I make 2 characters in the creator. As soon as I go to the floogle place, it only gives me only one character. 2. I put things on the walls, few seconds later it disappears also with other things it happens. Also, it won't let me open boxes. It's annoying because it's with my friend aswell.","I love this app and others do love it to but the only problem is, (why its only 4 stars) is it takes so long to load in the game for me, I have a samsung galaxy if that helps please make it load faster if you can and maybe add more houses? I think everyone would go bonkers if you added new houses and items and new hair styles and clothes, so sorry for only 4 stars but the loading could be better, but I look foreward to playing this game everyday!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tocaboca.tocalifeworld","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tocaboca.tocalifeworld&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Sygic GPS Navigation & Offline Maps","description":"Sygic GPS, Navigation is the world’s most downloaded Offline GPS navigation app, trusted by more than 200 million drivers.

I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Smashy Road: Wanted","description":"SMASHY ROAD: WANTED\r\n\r\nYou are WANTED!

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

Best part is that you dont have to upgrade your bot really to beat the boss, maybe just one or two. Also, no need to really purchase anything, just do good combos. The only bad thing is that you have to get google play so if you delete it you dont have any progress, make sure you save the progress!! To help you if you have trouble winning, purchase these robots: UWI Ambush UWII Six Shooter WRB I Gridlock WRB Albino WRB- Metro Gold","Overall, this is a good game. But, I bought a bunch of stuff on my iPhone, and logged into Facebook hoping to transfer my games data over to my Android phone, only it find out that none of it transfers across phones, but I can still log into Facebook. This is a little more than anoying, and if there's a way to fix the problem, this is an easy 5 star game.","I'll start by saying that a few days ago this would've been 4 starts as it's a fun game but the energy system slows it down. Today I got on and the game told me I hadn't beaten UWI yet? How? I have two WRBII robots and I was getting ready to fight Zues. So I though eh whatever I'll play through it really quick. So I equipped my old UWI robot and tried to go through the championship again. I beat UWI logged on the next day and the progress was gone once again. I still have all my robots and stuf","OK, all I can say is 'OUTSTANDING' with brilliant gameplay, astonishing graphics and gorgeous mechanics of the game itself. This one's better than the boxing champions I'm telling you. Gives me back many nostalgia! Playing since 2013 (it's first release) and I see there's alot changes now that really improved the game and impressed me, the mystery draw was a great thing coz you can win alot of unique robots like Zeus, Atom, Cosmobot and more! Good job reliance!","This game I'm played in 2016..all the stages completed..after I deleted the game..now in 2021. Again I downloaded and started playing..but I don't know there is a small problem I'm facing..3rd of August 21 massage I can see device blocked...why I can't understand...my all the ability cards and transform cards gone...what is this new problem??"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jumpgames.rswrb","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jumpgames.rswrb&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Talking Tom Cat 2","description":"The legend is back!

It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!!

Thanks","Its not better than the actual youtube. But one thing I don't like about this app is that the stuff I like to watch is in a whole different language.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much! Saying that the local news I receive is great and helps keep me up-to-date!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.particlenews.newsbreak","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.particlenews.newsbreak&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Baby Panda Home Safety","description":"Home is a special place.

Now play game of the next week to discuss my qualifications and experience to connect with me and you can get the latest flash player is required for video playback y me lo que me and the only thing I am totally trying and I like it and it is not reachable by phone or two lives in a shshsus by ysyehehshjs and I like it was not the next r of the next day or two lives of the only","It's my most favorite app that I've had. Also, I have been playing it since like 2016. All the animals are super cute and we love to work and do chores to earn some gems. There are only two problems that bother me quite a lot. One of them is that there are hardly any ways to get gems. I suggest you should put something in the app when people return to the app you give them like 50 or 100 extra gems. The other problem was that it always glitches every time it sends me out fix this now. FIX IT NOW","Pretty Good game to download if your parents aren't ok whith violence on mincraft. Not that much world to explore because computer repeats all the hills and lakes over and over again. But you do get to create your own village and unique builds, and then sell them on the build shop once you reach level 6 .you can explore other people's villages and give likes if you think they did a hefty job. So download if you can't have mincraft.","I've been playing this game for a long and I have some things to say: it's a very good game, you can say it's like mincraft, BUT, in some of the buildings I've blocked the doors so villagers can't get in but they always get in! That's quite annoying, second, I've build a little house far far from my village and now I can't find it! And third, I'm making a house by my own and I spend all the roofing and it's been 3 days and it hasn't refill that's soo annoying. Please do something about it.","I like it but in some places it might glitch but overall it's fine. I love playing this game in my free time, it just keeps me entertained. I really enjoy building my OWN buildings and I think it's a lot of fun. If the glitches were not there it would definitely be a 5 ☆ rating.

With a new set of songs each Wednesday, there is always more to explore. ","comments":["This is the first (and only) music app I have ever used. And my GOD what a choice of songs. YouTube Music must have every song 🎵 in the world!! And eventually if you hit the like button often enough they will create a list of just your favorite songs/videos. I pay for YouTube premium and I'm sure that's why I don't get any ads at all. I'm very 😊 happy with YouTube Music so far.","This app is alright. I have premium, so I can't comment of the ads. The functions for listening to songs are quite good. However, ocationaly on songs it will say they are from a different artist, or play a song to what it says and what the album cover is. For example, when I went into thefatrat's \"Rise up\" it played a song called solitude instead. This was later fixed, however, if I go to the song, \"Kings and Queens Part two\" by Ava Max, it will sometimes play the wrong song.","The radio option is the only thing I really don't like about it. When you selected \"radio\" on an artist in Google play music it played songs that were from similar artists. YTM however, seems to play songs from artists that you've listened to a lot. Example: Hit the radio button on a power metal artist and the radio starts playing a bunch of TOOL because I've listened to them a lot and it really doesn't fit at all, especially when I'm using it to explore other artists in the power metal genre.","Not fit for purpose. I've been trying to work with this junk since launch. Spent months creating 12 playlists across 12 genres, totalling 9,170 tracks to listen to my playlists across my 7 Google hub max speakers. However, regardless of what playlist you select, even on shuffle, it will always start off playing the first track. It will then continue to play the same 20 or 30 tracks over and over again all day long even when playlist has over 1000 tracks. Switched to Spotify yesterday, heaven!!","I enjoy using the app. It creates several Mixes for you from different genres & eras that you listen to so you can choose what you're in the mood for. Every Wednesday there's a Discover Mix which I love. It's a mix of music they think you'll like based on your music choices. I'd give it 5 stars, but they took away the tab that used to drop down with your task bar. That was great bc you could skip through songs without leaving the app you're currently in.

Mario Kart Tour doesn't feature invasive ads. sorry, this fancy version of Temple Run doesn't get to ruin my fun with non-removable ads. the nostalgia isn't worth a poor mobile game experience","It a really cool game, I used to play it all the time when it first came out and I just came back to it recently. I like it but there are a few bugs that need fixing. Mostly the event bug. After a few runs it doesn't save anymore progress, it'll just stay at a certain number, but it will use up your tickets. It's frustrating when it uses up all your tickets and your \"mines destroyed\" number is still the same number as before you used the ticket(s). Please fix the event bug, thank you.","Do you remember the first game? If you do you can see the bunch of problems from the new one if you don't I'm very shocked anyway now getting to the point of it first of all the animation aren't really smooth second of all to me it's really glitchy second of all why are they all Naruto running??????? That when I was like an answer the fact of the animations are not smooth and it's glitchy basically just ruined the whole entire game for me iI'm sorry but you have to fix this immediately","I gave this game one star because of multiple reasons and I don't think I was the only one that had these issues with this game. The game controls are very bad. Even worse than the first game's controls. Sometimes I tried to go to the left and the game would send me all the way to the right. This happened way more times than I can keep track of. This game is very unfinished and the developers almost never worked on it after it was released. I saw the game, tried it and it was worse than 06. Fix","I played this game in an IPhone 7 for years and it didn't give me issues. I had everyone maxed out. Now I changed to an android and now runs really bad. This game laggs so hard that the game freezes and crashes all together. When an event appears, I use all the tickets and loose all of my progress on that run. I've tried three times and it gives me the same results. This update is garbage!

I love the concept of being able to customize I've played this game for years and I've been on and off with it. I had the game downloaded about two years ago and had no problems. But now in 2021 whenever I try to play the game freezes and I cant do anything except the info button and once I restart it, it says my profile has been banned for unauthorized activity even tho I havent played the game in years. Plz help😐","It's a good game, the reason why I'm giving this a 3-star is because I have a lot of problem since I was playing this game, sometimes when I fight the enemies once I drop their hp to 0, they still stay alive, and my other problem is it's hard to get rewards, I would suggest increasing the drop rate after winning the game, my third problem is the energy cores, it takes too long to recharge them back again, that's all.","Good game all around and though I do prefer the original version for sure this is quite the upgrade in terms of origins for the bot, also while I do find some of the items can be extremely expensive there are often ways to counteract this such as with the upgrading parts to silver gold etc: the solution I found was to do sparring matches on pro every time I got 5 energy cores until I had enough cash. This is still an amazing game, thanks alot","Really enjoyed playing this game... Loved the ability to make your own robot from a wide range of parts, moves and designs. Just one thing though, when my screen doesn't show attack effects, like the sparks and hit effects, does it have to do with my phone or the fact that it is an android one?","I love this game but it is a little hard the the beginning the ai is tough and you can only fo five fights until it recharges but once you reach pvp it gets a lot easier cause you get things called cores for robots and another currence and you can sometimes get enough cores to get an elemental part which is only like 150 cores which are not hard to get."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.reliancegames.rschampions","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reliancegames.rschampions&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Sonic Dash - Endless Running & Racing Game","description":"The original Sonic the Hedgehog endless running & racing game!

Plus it is so much fun. One of the best mobile games and it is fun for everyone even if you haven't played a sonic game or if don't know who or what sonic is. So If you wanna play a good on the go mobile game then play this.","Its great overall yet instead of speeding up or adding obstacles it shortens the distance between obstacles making it near impossible to get past certain points without paying red rings using a lucky bubble or having a dash ready so yeah","Having a great time. Can't wait to unlock more characters! Finally downloaded this game when I heard Tangle and Whisper from the IDW comics were unlockable!","Fun game, the adds aren't too disruptive, and there are multiple characters to choose from. My two biggest hang ups are 1; the obstacles, some are just impossible to get around. And 2; some characters you actually have to pay for with real money! I think they should give the option to get retro Sonic by beating the games best hi-score. But overall, good game.","It's really fun for an endless runner, but like all games of that style, it gets boring real quick. Maybe that's a personal preference thing... Either way, I love the Sonic universe and characters, but I wouldn't recommend throwing your money at it.

Why does this app need access to such things? Shouldn't an omegle app, only have access to things such as camera and microphone? Why do you need access to my phone calls, and my gallery? Do not waste your time on this app. Shady developers.","i imagine this app would be somewhat good if i could even use it, why does this app need access to my photos and phone calls? its stupid. i shouldnt be unable to use the app just because i didnt allow it to access my camera roll. fix this.","This is nice app. I would have rated it with 5 stars however the only issue I found that even after selecting the any particular country I am only able to find people of my local country only. It is very rare I am finding people with different country ... I believe tab for selecting country has no use ... You should either delete the tab or it should work properly. Suppose if I am selecting Canada so I should be only able to talk to the people of Canada only..","All over this app is so nice and amazing app. But the problem is when I want to talk French people it will keep showing the my country people. It will rarely go for France people. I requested to all ome TV team to fix this.","I give one star for one reason Because I can only connect with local strangers even when I change my location .. I can meet new local people in real life or social media .. why I need your app then ? also they are too many kids and they still connected for days .. you should stop him not me when I hide my face Even when I use strong VPN .. still same serveur ( only local ) .. how did you know my location !
