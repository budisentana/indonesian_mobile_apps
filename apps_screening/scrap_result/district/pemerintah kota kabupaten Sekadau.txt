How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home. So, instead of just opening the tracker in another browser tab, the developers in their infinite wisdom have decided that it is better if you unlock your phone, open the app, and then be able to locate.

Location portion should be improved. It's clunky, and would be nice if you could narrow it down to counties in order to refine the list for the time of year. Update: I still use the app, and it's good, but after the latest update, 5/16/21, all ofy locations have been deleted... Loss of a star","Like other recent reviews, I have used this app for some time, but now I can't get past the opening pelican screen. I tried reinstalling, but that made no difference. I tried a device restart - no difference. Update - Just for the heck of it, I tried opening the app the next day and it worked. I did nothing different between attempts. Maybe it was that cup of Birds & Beans coffee in the morning before trying again.","The last so called 'bug-fix and performance improvement' update messed up the app. My locations and alerts are gone. Even if i add a new location it does not show up, preventing me from adding a sighting. Been more than a week still no fix. Please roll back the update and revert to the last stable version. Cleary, basic testing was skipped before rolling out the update. Very disappointing.","Love this app and its features. No annoying ad popups. You can search for just your area, or birds by color, size, and more. Lots of interesting info on the birds such as nest behavior, feeding behavior, range, and more. It has their different calls and a lot of pictures for reference.","App is nice until it doesn't work. It lost all my locations after about a month of use. The sightings still show their original locations, but my list of locations to select from is blank. If I make new locations, my old sightings won't be connected with them. This has effectively made the app unusable for cataloguing sightings.

Once NOOK learns your reading speed, tap the footer to cycle between page count, chapter time, book time and empty state.<br>• Added the ability to view annotations from the Library.<br>• Additional bug fixes and performance improvements.","comments":["I used to love Nook! Now, I'm stuck with it. It doesn't automatically open the book like it did in the beginning. Nook now stores most of my books in the \"Cloud.\" I'm not impressed with \"Cloud\" storage. Furthermore, Nook now acts like it needs an intervention. It acts like it's addicted to both uppers & downers! I like the idea of having books at my fingertips. I just don't like what my Nook has become. A drag.","I've used a Nook for years. I hate latest update. The feature that allows you to skip back and forth in book without having to turn each individual page doesn't show up most of the time. Same goes for ability to change font size. The \"improvements\" that predict how long it will take to finish a chapter or the book don't make up for what was lost and aren't something I need.","If I could rate this nook device (Lenovo tablet) with zero stars or a negative rating, I would. I can't save any of my ebooks to my SD card, the area is grayed out & the button doesn't work & Google is imbedded in the tablet's software seems to think that my tablet's a phone. It's hard to flip back & forth on the tablet & the software doesn't allow me to change users very easily. I really wish that I'd just bought a regular tablet.","The reading speed function is extremely annoying and you can't turn it off. I want to know what page I am on not how fast I am reading. I love my nook but this latest update of reading speed has dropped me from 5 stars to 3 and the 3 is being generous. I understand some may like knowing how fast they are reading so at least give us the option to disable it","Last update completely ruined Nook reading. Takes so long to load a book get a msg asking if I want to continue TWICE. Many times it has been impossible to even turn a page of the book I am trying to read. If I didn't have so many unread books I would probably ditch Nook and go with Amazon. It is as if whoever did the update wanted people to ditch this reader. Samsung should be ashamed to let their app fall apart, maybe I should reconsider getting a Samsung

Can't search the exact content, but pushing many under quality videos, it is like a promoted channel. I tried now several times to edit settings, same result. Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .
