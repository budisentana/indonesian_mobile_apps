There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little. But they slowed the car like WAY too much."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rkgames.smashywanted","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rkgames.smashywanted&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google News - Top world & local news headlines","description":"Google News is a personalized news aggregator that organizes and highlights what’s happening in the world so you can discover more about the stories that matter to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nStay up to date on your interests\r\n\r\n• The For You tab delivers the top stories across all your favorite topics and sources in one place.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Assistant Go","description":"Lightweight and fast, yet still packed with your favorite features, the Google Assistant is now available on Android (Go edition).\r\n\r\nUse your voice to get directions to the nearest coffee shop, make calls hands free during your commute, and unwind by playing your favorite tunes.

The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much! Saying that the local news I receive is great and helps keep me up-to-date!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.particlenews.newsbreak","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.particlenews.newsbreak&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Waplog - Dating App to Chat & Meet New People","description":"Waplog Dating App\r\n\r\nThe fastest-growing dating app with more than 90 million users worldwide.

Best part is that you dont have to upgrade your bot really to beat the boss, maybe just one or two. Also, no need to really purchase anything, just do good combos. The only bad thing is that you have to get google play so if you delete it you dont have any progress, make sure you save the progress!! To help you if you have trouble winning, purchase these robots: UWI Ambush UWII Six Shooter WRB I Gridlock WRB Albino WRB- Metro Gold","Overall, this is a good game. But, I bought a bunch of stuff on my iPhone, and logged into Facebook hoping to transfer my games data over to my Android phone, only it find out that none of it transfers across phones, but I can still log into Facebook. This is a little more than anoying, and if there's a way to fix the problem, this is an easy 5 star game.","I'll start by saying that a few days ago this would've been 4 starts as it's a fun game but the energy system slows it down. Today I got on and the game told me I hadn't beaten UWI yet? How? I have two WRBII robots and I was getting ready to fight Zues. So I though eh whatever I'll play through it really quick. So I equipped my old UWI robot and tried to go through the championship again. I beat UWI logged on the next day and the progress was gone once again. I still have all my robots and stuf","OK, all I can say is 'OUTSTANDING' with brilliant gameplay, astonishing graphics and gorgeous mechanics of the game itself. This one's better than the boxing champions I'm telling you. Gives me back many nostalgia! Playing since 2013 (it's first release) and I see there's alot changes now that really improved the game and impressed me, the mystery draw was a great thing coz you can win alot of unique robots like Zeus, Atom, Cosmobot and more! Good job reliance!","This game I'm played in 2016..all the stages completed..after I deleted the game..now in 2021.

Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!!

That is not enough time, and to automatically start charging your Google Play account, I thought this app had a free version. I can't get to the free version. What ever happened to \"try before you buy? Edit: OK, it is possible to kill both\" free trial offer\" screens and try the app, just a lot of ads. I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate.

I listed myself in the top 5% but did not get any rewards. Even after waiting for 48 hours, I received no rewards. If this happens on continual basis, I will definitely lose my interest and likewise many more...","This is an incredible game that I just can't get away from. It's not like other games where you are forced to watch ads to do anything, so that's a huge plus. I can never get bored of this game and I'm in love with the character designs and the graphics and everything about it. There is a power system, stopping you from playing for hours and hours, but I like it because then I can get out and do things, instead of being a couch potato. Thanks for creating such an amazing, fun, game!","The Game is well designed in appearing the smallest deatails of each character, however each variant of the charter all ways has the same special 1 and 3, to make it appealing and interesting you could change the super speacial to something a little different to other character. The survivor mode is fun but the wheel of fortune is not balanced in terms of probability, i tend to get more crystals then any other prize on the wheel. But over all its a whell designed game.","This game is epic I love how it is offline because all offline games are soo boring unlike this one. I think there needs to be an update and include more player though. On my tablet this game is perfect but on my phone for some reason after I've played a battle it goes off the game and into my home screen so I never get my XP and have to do the fight again but it still takes my energy bars and the process repeats so I dont move on. Please help me fix this","I have been playing this game for queit some time now and i really do like but there are some issues in the game that really need to be fixed. First of all in the online battle when i ranked in the top 20 i didnt recive any reward..... I waited for quiet some time but still did not recieve anything. The next thing is that sometimes i dont get daily logim rewards.Add some updates in this game like Being able to send stuff of tours to friends, multiplayer mode to play with people of your choosing."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.wb.goog.injustice","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.injustice&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"The New York Times","description":"Understand the world around you with original reporting from The New York Times.

Today the video ad turned itself on without my tapping it, and turned off the music I was listening to in the background. The search function is terrible. Sometimes I cannot find a recent article to reread, even if I search with a key phrase I remember from the title.","The app works just fine. Anytime my Android is on, I can go on the app and read the articles with no problem. The categories are Most Popular, World News, U.S. News, Politics, Business, New York News, Sports, Arts, Magazine, Photos, Technology, Health, Science, Climate and Environment, Food, Books, Movies, Theater, Style, Celebrity Weddings, Travel, Real Estate, Automobiles, and National Obituaries. There are no pop-ups unless I want them.","There is simply no coverage of the country, and the world, that matches that of the Times. While I find many of the Top stories on SmartNews interesting, the online renderings of the Times and the Washington Post, provide me with the majority of the news (other than that in Tulsa and Oklahoma) I find both interesting and useful.","I would put 5 stars for content. However the app is so bad and useless, that it is a one star. If you are not connected to the internet, forget about reading the times offline. It just doesn't work. So forget about enjoying the times on your Android tablet or ipad in the train, plane or the park if wifi is unavailable. Thinking of stopping my subscription as it is a frustrating app","Greatest U.S. newspaper going, BUT, if you plan to access on an Android device, even new tablets, FORGET IT. The app freezes, locks you out, dishes epic amounts of ads -- poorly formatted and that interfere with content. I tried for months to resolve via costomer service. NYT is excellent at responding to complaints, not so good at following up.

A complete charged battery (4750mAh) drains off within 6 hours. Didn't have this problem before. For this reason I give only two stars. Solve the problem and I will rate it with five stars 😉 Update 26th July 2021: It looks like the issue is fixed. 5 stars for a top app!","Doesn't have the most popular radio stations this it's not really a radio app, it's a BS app. Uninstalled. One-starred. Laughed about non-app. Middle finger to the screen. Telling every single person I speak with, stranger or acquaintance that Simple Radio sucks, even if the conversation is completely unrelated. I will say this to every single person I interact with. If I meet someone new that'll be the first thing I tell them. I have never done this with any app. It sucks that much.","Love this app, I use it all the time! However there is one problem :^: .... My station (particularly the Jazz Radio station in Lyon Rhode Alps in France keeps cutting out, even though it says it's playing. If I try to pause and play it again, the whole app shuts down. Please fix it, I really love this app and my jazz 🙏 Edit: fixed!!! Thank you!!","I've enjoyed using it..... For the first month I had it. Been using it for almost a year and I'm getting real tired of the random closing. I'll be listening to the radio and I'll have a 4 or 5 bar signal and my station stops. So I have to unlock my phone and restart the station to continue listening. I listen to talk radio a lot so I get to miss out on important talks because of random closures. And the app has been patched many times and it still does it. So obviously it isn't a priority.","AGAIN: STATION loses connection. UPDATE: HAPPENING AGAIN!! STILL STOPPING! WHEN GOING TO FIX? FIRE YOUR AD PERSON. The developer Has REPETITIVELY FAILED to fix the APP & it the app stops multiple times in as short as 15 minutes.. Ads may be necessary in free mode, but if you have to hold your phone to constantly restart, it is not worth ads and doesn't make one feel that the paid version will be stable."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.streema.simpleradio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.streema.simpleradio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Play Books & Audiobooks","description":"Google Play Books is the one app you need for enjoying audiobooks and ebooks purchased from Google Play.\r\n\r\nChoose from millions of best selling ebooks, comics, textbooks, and audiobooks.

To honor this grand occasion, King Ludwig has organised a host of special anniversary events and rewards for your pleasure. Thank you all for your many years of loyalty; we could not have asked for better lords and ladies!","comments":["This game was brilliant, and I had played it for many years, however the \"blacksmith balancing update\" has made the game impossible to play, for anyone who doesn't spend money. I think about half of the players have stopped playing now. What the developers haven't seen, is that if the spenders don't have anyone who doesn't spend to compete with, they won't have to spend as much to get the same rewards, so the game developers wi get less money I hope this change is reverted soon. Thanks.","Decided to play game with friends and family, only to find out moving servers is a total loss (monies already spent and game money in my account) and I would have to start all over. Has been completely disappointing and never a response from games customer support. Don't waste money on this game as can clearly see they do not listen players and have no concern for them. I suggest looking for something more player friendly. Can see how they created empire by stealing from players.","One has to pay too high a price in real dollar$ and game coins for what you're needing to advance while playing this game. I also learned the hard way, that you have very little chance against Ruby players who are unethical bullies, whether they are players and/or Alliances. There's no recourse when players and Alliances do not follow the rules of the game. Also, why can't you play the game without downloading the updates?","After I updated the game it was demanding update again. so I deleted and installed the app to get rid of the bug. Since I couldn't remember my password I requested a password change but I noticed the game server is also changed and my progress is gone. The game can also be laggy most of the times. It is a good old game but not suitable for modern times and it has very bad bugs. most of players are inactive.","It's a good game overall, except when ever the game has it's bugs... Which seems to happen A LOT.... But what surprised me the most, was that this company gave me my money back. This review used to be vary different, I complained about losing money by buying some stuff and not getting it... Know I'm leaving my review with 4 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"air.com.goodgamestudios.empirefourkingdoms","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.goodgamestudios.empirefourkingdoms&hl=en&gl=us"}]
