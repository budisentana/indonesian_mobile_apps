Squashed bugs, fine-tuned the look and feel, and made sure you’re ready to keep binging your favorite content. Download the app today!","comments":["After what seems to be a recent update, it has become extremely tedious to rewatch a TV series. It doesn't properly keep track of what episode you're on where you were at and the episode when you go back to watch it again. It will constantly skip full episodes or restart ones that you were already watching instead of resuming from where you left off.","Hulu, you guys and girls coverage of the 2020 Olympics was horrible! 2 days of speed walking really? Your coverage of the real track and field sports was disgusting! YouTube TV here I come. I understand how television works. A lot of the responsibility falls on the networks shoulders like all of the NBC affiliates but you guys are all friends and have had many, many meetings before the Olympics started. It's pretty bad when the best coverage has been on KGW. That's our FREE local NBC channel!","While I love Hulu and appreciate it as a cord cutter. The app on my TV and here never seems to be able to go back to where I left off in series. It doesn't even start up at the episode I left off. If every other app can do this. HULU should be able to also. It's annoying to have to go back and dig for the season, episode and scene I left of at.","Streaming service is great, but the Android app is awful. I'm watching something where I frequently need to pause to read subs of translated onscreen signs or other text. Touching the screen doesn't pause the video. The pause button is small, and only becomes visible after I click the screen. By the time I hit Pause, the caption is already gone, so I have to back the video up, rinse and repeat.","Frustrated that since the last update every time I exit out or I pause and my screen times out, it starts my show over at the beginning. Then I have to sit and wait for the beginning ad to finish before jumping, to hopefully the right spot. It used to remember where I left off and that has changed. I also noticed that my watch history is all jacked. Sometimes it shows a show I watched a week ago, sometimes it shows an episode like 3 episodes ahead. I'm the only one on my account.

It will do the job but make you hate yourself for it. The interface is very heavy feeling and at times a pain to navigate. Its like trying to take a detour with no signs. They have catagories... sorta, but I am convinced it was just a program vomiting content after a night of cheap liquor. It has the vibe of a designed team that remember their assignment 3 hours before the deadline. Bring a GPS you're going to need it to find your way around.","More adds than video content. Often the videos fail, but don't worry the advertisements never do. If you try to rewatch a 10 second clip that recently failed, you'll have to watch the advertisement again, which never fails to run. Unacceptable for a company as large as it is, and owned by Disney. Get it together boys and girls....You should be better than this. I pay a monthly subscription for this, rediculous!","Incredibly terrible app for this size company. Load times are awful, there are 30 second unskippable commercials that freeze, so you wait 2 minutes to watch 25 seconds of content followed by more commercials. The watch app is terrible, I have espn+ membership but I'm unable to watch games that are on broadcast television like ABC, because I don't have a cable membership. Their watch section is laid out terribly and it's vague what you are able to watch with your membership. So bad.","If it weren't a dang monopoly, I would've deleted this app years ago. Slow load times, has no problem loading 40 second ads, but then won't load the 10 second highlight you came to see. But wait, try to find the highlight anywhere else, and it'll kick you back to their app. Please, for the love of God, can yahoo, or fox sports, or literally anyone make a half decent app for sports.

So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self.

It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard.

I had to stop and switch to my tablet. It doesn't let you skip ahead to that spot but has to show you every single commercial they've dropped into the movie to get to that point. It was over 10 minutes of commercials to get back to that point! I understand showing one commercial break, but this was unbelievably excessive. Forget it! I'll just wait until I can get back to my TV which is still sitting there on pause (thankfully).","I love this app! It is all free, many Series, Movies, Novels, Etc to see! You can use application or games while you Pluto TV !!! and the ad that appears on TV is the same as the application!!! The app is very good, only that I would like them to put a search engine to be able to search for Series, Movies, Novels, etc. But the app is very good, I give it 5 stars! Thanks Pluto TV :)","I loved this app until yesterday. It crashed & now all I get is the splash screen then a message that says cannot connect, check your connection. There's nothing wrong with my connection as all my other apps work perfectly fine. I've cleared the cache, uninstalled & reinstalled, & restarted my device. Nothing helps so now I can't watch it at all,","When it has trouble playing, it skips important parts of the movie. Trying to pickup where I left off is near impossible. I can only play from the beginning and try to find the spot where it I left off. Every time I do, it plays a string of ads. Also the ads are often much louder than the movie. On the positive side, it has a great selection of movies and shows. It always works with my miracast when Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ will not. Tubi only works with some titles.","I love the app. My reason for 4 stars and not 5 is two fold- I don't mind commercials but there are so many and inconveniently timed as well. My main complaint is there is no search option. I'd love to be able to search the \"on demand\" section to see if a title is available or still available.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving.

Suscription is axed, this works worse than Google Play Music with an horrible UI. Furthermore it does not integrate into any streaming service and equipment for music outside those few chromecast ones. Quality in sound is well behind other services as well... Is sad to say that the mismanegement of products in Google as of now makes me very suspicious to drop my money on anything google from now on. Sad.","After so many years, can we have some basic playlist editing features like SELECTING MULTIPLE SONGS or SORTING?!?!?!??!!?!?!?!?! These features are so basic that users started asking for them since the start of this sorry excuse you call a product. And great job ignoring us for years. I hope you are proud of yourselves: you took away a perfectly adequate product that is Google Play Music and incompetently gave us this pathetic \"fancy\" replacement with a stupid AI suggesting horrible songs and no adequate functionality to build our own playlists. You should thank the oligopoly that I still allow your undeserving staff to make money off of me. I'm paying mostly to get rid of youtube ads.","Seldom works as promised. If you want to stream random songs this might be fine, but it DOES NOT WORK to play your own music as requested. Completely fails to shuffle playlists: plays the same songs, in the same order, over and over, every time. WARNING - if you use this service to upload your own music files you can NOT get them back, except as unlabeled zip files without folders; they gave me mine as 44 different 2gig files I had to download individually. Crazy! Display of titles is shockingly awful: it often can't fit the whole song title or band name, across various platforms. The inability to select more than one track at a time is absurd and makes manipulating Playlists extremely cumbersome. Works half as well as Pandora but insists on reverting to its own recommendations rather than the requested songs. Functionality with Android Auto is spotty as best: in the car I can't NOT shuffle a playlist, on the TV via AndoirdTV I can only play a playlist in exact order, and using voice commands to my speaker it can't shuffle. Paying for Google1 access to try and fix the bugs was completely pointless, an offensive waste of time and money (\"Have you tried resetting and reinstalling it?\" LOL great support). They kept promising it was going to get better and it just keeps working worse... I've been a Premium member and was a Google Music Play user since day one (and happily would have paid that fee forever!), but now I'm quitting because I'm paying them a monthly fee in order to NOT stream my own music. This has been a horrendous nightmare inflicted on me by those I trusted most with my precious music library, and I don't plan on letting them forget about their failure any time soon. The fact that so many users have been requesting the addition of a Sleep Time for so long-- and it goes ignored-- shows me they just don't care. Most frustrating of all, every single problem I've mentioned was non-existent on the Google Play Music planform before this awful \"upgrade.\" Music lovers should steer far clear of this app if you hope to control your own listening experience.","Just a redirect to YouTube itself, prioritises videos over music. Can't find a browse by album. You're better off using the YouTubeMusic app on your phone and casting to your TV than using this app. At least that way you can browse or find albums/songs/artists you want and control their playback. O, and no background playback, so unlike every other music player app on Android TV (Spotify, Pandora, etc), you can't exit this app and let it run in the background while, say, having your screen saver run. How can Google's own music app on its own platform be worse than third party apps? Or even worse than what they have done before with GPM?! Regression, not progression from Google:(","Terrible experience. Hard to find any content, and if you do get lucky enough to find some content/playlist one day - good luck finding it again on another day, as it seems like it randomly changes what playlists and content is available to you, except for a few of the exact same things that always show up"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.youtube.tvmusic","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube.tvmusic&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"HBO Max: Stream and Watch TV, Movies, and More","description":"HBO Max is a premium streaming app that combines all of HBO with even more must-see TV series, blockbuster movies, and exclusive Max Originals.\r\n\r\nWith unlimited access to thousands of hours of entertainment, we’ve got something for everyone in your family.

Which is pretty regular unfortunately. Not worth my subscription fee if it ain't mobile. The service is almost worse on my Xbox and Playstation. Constant crashes, lag when trying to fast forward or rewind. A painful experience almost everytime I use it, which isn't very often. Guess I'm canceling again, because after 6 months, they still can't figure out how to create a stable, user friendly product.","I love the content. However, watching through a Roku, it is miserable trying to actually watch anything. It didn't start out that way. Now, first of all, it is slow loading when I open the app. Then, I try to start a show, wait for it not to play so it can kick me out of the app, reopen the app, navigate again to what I want to watch... repeat 10, 15, 20, etc times until it finally plays what I want to watch, or give up in frustration and switch over to a streaming service that works properly.","It is a good app for the most PART. I have been with HBO from the start, I live in one of the first cities where it started. I started to have issues with the app over the last few days. 1: despite trying several times have not been able to update it. 2: the sound went off as I was watching Bill Maure. It was the app as the sound worked with all other apps.","The app rarely plays correctly. Just about everything thing I watch on HBO Max must be restarted several times for the video to play correctly. For example, the audio will play with no video or the audio/video are out of sync. At $14.99/month, this is the most expensive app on my Roku device and the ONLY one that doesn't work! Don't waste your money or your time.","It's a great app, I like the fact that I can manage my subscription on it. I find the settings for a child account to be really nice. I like that I can select each rating individual so when my kids get older I can just raise the rating to a comfortable level. I honestly don't know why there is so many negative ratings it's not overly jarring with buffering or crashing granted that could be because my internet service is decent.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate.

Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building. It also have military, airport, railway, minerals, space oruented,....etc 3.In each and every places has unique song i really have enjoyed it. 4.

Neither the trailer nor the main video plays. I'm not sure why this is the case. If my TV did not support prime video, the videos should not have played in any case, right? Could you please assist me?","I can kinda look past it's horrible interface and it's buggyness, what I can't get past is the fact that it always streams in 720p with a very low bitrate on my 4k tv(!) and 1gbps internet connection. I've resorted to just using the chromecast in the android app, because even with more hoops to jump through, at least I don't have to use this horrible, horrible app anymore. You're amazon, you have more money than multiple countries combined, make a decent app.","The user interface is laughable. The app is slow and the stream often crashes when trying to resume playback. When resuming right after turning on the TV, the entire app locks up and I have to kill it manually. There is no option to rate the content from within the app. Why is there no proper history option? Subtitles are often formatted wrong (words sticking together, wrong characters etc.), original audio streams are often missing even though they are listed in the overview, which in itself is utterly bare-bone. There is no option to scroll the movie description, and they are so truncated that you often won't get any useful information out of it. This is one of the biggest companies in the world, how can the TV-app be THIS BAD?!","Someone at Amazon needs to write a Jeff Memo about this app. It's embarrassingly bad. Launching it takes forever, very slow to navigate, often it will sometimes refuse to play at all. I expected to look at this app and see it hasn't been updated in two years.

With a new set of songs each Wednesday, there is always more to explore. ","comments":["This is the first (and only) music app I have ever used. And my GOD what a choice of songs. YouTube Music must have every song 🎵 in the world!! And eventually if you hit the like button often enough they will create a list of just your favorite songs/videos. I pay for YouTube premium and I'm sure that's why I don't get any ads at all. I'm very 😊 happy with YouTube Music so far.","This app is alright. I have premium, so I can't comment of the ads. The functions for listening to songs are quite good. However, ocationaly on songs it will say they are from a different artist, or play a song to what it says and what the album cover is. For example, when I went into thefatrat's \"Rise up\" it played a song called solitude instead. This was later fixed, however, if I go to the song, \"Kings and Queens Part two\" by Ava Max, it will sometimes play the wrong song.","The radio option is the only thing I really don't like about it. When you selected \"radio\" on an artist in Google play music it played songs that were from similar artists. YTM however, seems to play songs from artists that you've listened to a lot. Example: Hit the radio button on a power metal artist and the radio starts playing a bunch of TOOL because I've listened to them a lot and it really doesn't fit at all, especially when I'm using it to explore other artists in the power metal genre.","Not fit for purpose. I've been trying to work with this junk since launch. Spent months creating 12 playlists across 12 genres, totalling 9,170 tracks to listen to my playlists across my 7 Google hub max speakers. However, regardless of what playlist you select, even on shuffle, it will always start off playing the first track. It will then continue to play the same 20 or 30 tracks over and over again all day long even when playlist has over 1000 tracks. Switched to Spotify yesterday, heaven!!","I enjoy using the app. It creates several Mixes for you from different genres & eras that you listen to so you can choose what you're in the mood for. Every Wednesday there's a Discover Mix which I love. It's a mix of music they think you'll like based on your music choices. I'd give it 5 stars, but they took away the tab that used to drop down with your task bar. That was great bc you could skip through songs without leaving the app you're currently in.

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"}]
