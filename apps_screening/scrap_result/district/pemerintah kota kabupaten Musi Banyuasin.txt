Dinilai sukses, E-KTP akhirnya diberlakukan secara nasional, geng.<br><br>Banyak hal yang melatarbelakangi mengapa pemerintah meminta kita pindah ke E-KTP, salah satunya adalah banyaknya temuan kasus KTP ganda yang beredar dan digunakan untuk hal-hal negatif, seperti:<br><br>Menghindari pembayaran pajak;<br>Menyembunyikan identitas diri, contohnya para pelaku kriminal yang masuk ke dalam Daftar Pencarian Orang (DPO);<br>Mengamankan tindakan korupsi atau bentuk kejahatan lainnya.<br>Dengan adanya E-KTP, diharapkan kegelisahan masyarakat bisa mereda karena sekarang semua informasi tersimpan secara digital sehingga susah untuk dimanipulasi.","summary":"how to check your KTP and KK Online 2020","installs":"50,000+","minInstalls":50000,"maxInstalls":83588,"score":3.059406,"scoreText":"3.1","ratings":315,"reviews":176,"histogram":{"1":130,"2":3,"3":21,"4":34,"5":124},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"7.6M","androidVersion":"4.0.3","androidVersionText":"4.0.3 and up","developer":"aziza media","developerId":"aziza+media","developerEmail":"abdul.azis.sip@gmail.com","privacyPolicy":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vjkQ1cMrUBE22PZnhvF6JjVDqLzQklDAJoLRWqJmk14/edit?usp=sharing","developerInternalID":"5483288239222182300","genre":"Books & Reference","genreId":"BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eXUZkIzy2_RFqkYyaQ6yC8n7v4aAE94iDyGoAi0yMrWRA35qTZFlzRT2n5_bWHfmOg","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ld2OYBgrQpy1dMPDqfFzLGbZFEouXtnacxYEIbMJpRGsaEIVNeDXErhzUSchfHDt0Smc","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YCubg6T3vIk_AoBFFD4evBhf8K-gM92rJHkPIbb2p6rbSICa1TTp2fSmV05V3MdfIlA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/etQc3jmRPOY6ledP-bVqV_LmbhmYVDd_Hyk7nwlAlKfL6ojIHQtTlXpttJs5Oj4CmcE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QijHMYPTXFsHxGjanCc_3ZAI61jkcVTo4Smc29fDEV9rstV-ekE_8pt4zniR8JJj2tk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8zmkiao65LEFPUUSdE8pPdFcG0o0xT5IoX8FD3RV2BgAqSB0WLIKq4wDT9GOm4BobCWb"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Jan 6, 2020","updated":1578322252000,"version":"1.0","comments":["Kontol","Aplikasi ga ada guna"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.azizamedia.cara_cek_ktp_dan_kk_online","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azizamedia.cara_cek_ktp_dan_kk_online&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Cek NIK KTP Online","description":"Cek NIK KTP Online - Merupakan aplikasi yang dapat digunakan untuk melihat informasi NIK KTP berdasarkan hasil kodifikasi 16 digit nomor NIK. \r\n\r\nBATASAN: Aplikasi Cek NIK KTP ini,  BUKAN bersumber pada data DisDukCaPil. \r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: APLIKASI INI TIDAK MEWAKILI INSTANSI PEMERINTAH.

For technical help, please email appstore@tunein.com.","comments":["Pretty good app overall, but one major negative is that it loses connection a lot and every time I hit pause, even if it's just for a few seconds, the app makes me listen to a 30 second ad! Very, very very annoying when I'm listening to a live sports game! Please stop being so greedy and fix this issue! Put like a 5 minute grace period in or something reasonable.","Enjoy this application for many years now. However, recently I am having issues with the sleep timer on my favorite radio station. Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","It's a good app, you can access 1000s of stations but one of the joys that made it similar to listening to a real live radio was the sleep timer feature. It's not working on the current version for some reason which is a shame and a pain. Not an issue if listening during the day, I would imagine though.","App often goes into endless cycle of ads and doesn't return to radio station I'm listening to. I understand having ads when I'm not paying for subscription but I just listened to 20 minutes of ads and had to turn off because it won't return to radio station I was listening to.

With a new set of songs each Wednesday, there is always more to explore. ","comments":["This is the first (and only) music app I have ever used. And my GOD what a choice of songs. YouTube Music must have every song 🎵 in the world!! And eventually if you hit the like button often enough they will create a list of just your favorite songs/videos. I pay for YouTube premium and I'm sure that's why I don't get any ads at all. I'm very 😊 happy with YouTube Music so far.","This app is alright. I have premium, so I can't comment of the ads. The functions for listening to songs are quite good. However, ocationaly on songs it will say they are from a different artist, or play a song to what it says and what the album cover is. For example, when I went into thefatrat's \"Rise up\" it played a song called solitude instead. This was later fixed, however, if I go to the song, \"Kings and Queens Part two\" by Ava Max, it will sometimes play the wrong song.","The radio option is the only thing I really don't like about it. When you selected \"radio\" on an artist in Google play music it played songs that were from similar artists. YTM however, seems to play songs from artists that you've listened to a lot. Example: Hit the radio button on a power metal artist and the radio starts playing a bunch of TOOL because I've listened to them a lot and it really doesn't fit at all, especially when I'm using it to explore other artists in the power metal genre.","Not fit for purpose. I've been trying to work with this junk since launch. Spent months creating 12 playlists across 12 genres, totalling 9,170 tracks to listen to my playlists across my 7 Google hub max speakers. However, regardless of what playlist you select, even on shuffle, it will always start off playing the first track. It will then continue to play the same 20 or 30 tracks over and over again all day long even when playlist has over 1000 tracks. Switched to Spotify yesterday, heaven!!","I enjoy using the app. It creates several Mixes for you from different genres & eras that you listen to so you can choose what you're in the mood for. Every Wednesday there's a Discover Mix which I love. It's a mix of music they think you'll like based on your music choices. I'd give it 5 stars, but they took away the tab that used to drop down with your task bar. That was great bc you could skip through songs without leaving the app you're currently in.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing.

Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features.

I can now give it my hearty recommendation again. It has an excellent selection regardless of your taste in music, and the sound quality is excellent. If you have a good, or unlimited, data plan, you can relegate your personal collection to backup status.","I used to have a positive experiencewith Pandora but once i found SPOTIFY it totally changed my life, i have found so many new artists on spotify full albums no problem, and now that i am trying to cancel Pandora, its impossible, they just keep taking my 5.99 every month, customer service good luck trying to find anybody?????? Try SPOTIFY beforeyou ever try this app😡😠😡😠😡","Instead of us troubleshooting, how about you fix it. If everyone is having the same issue connecting to Chromecast, it's your problem not ours. If this doesn't get resolved during my 30 day premium trial, I'll definitely return to Spotify... I suggest everyone reading this comment to do the same! Yes I checked the Pandora community and they all have the same issue. Unfortunately back to Spotify...","Please add ability to reorder stations not only by recent and a-z. I have discovered so many new songs that I love. I miss the comment feature it allowed me to follow people with similar tastes and discover more awesome songs. Please bring that feature back. Also miss the feature that allowed me to scroll thru all the music I played now have to go one by one. Also please bring back 30 sec sample of song. It allowed to listen to songs by same artist if i liked them. Thanks keep up the good work.","I used to love Pandora and pay for offline listening. I've deleted half my stations just to get variety on offline thumbprint radio but once I go offline, I only have the same 3 songs playing. And the variety sucks. Only popular songs by an artist ever come up. Listen. I like full albums. The same 4 Foo Fighters songs is pretty old. It isn't worth it anymore. Nothing new ever comes up.

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Whatever it's only $8 a month, $10 if you want the privilage of being able to stream offline.","Love it, I bought premium so I can watch offline. would give it a five star but I have one problem there's been times when it doesn't load the the episode. I've tried logging out and then back in, restarting my phone, and turn phone fully off and back on. That hasn't work so I'm going to try uninstalling and then we installing. Hopefully that works","I don't understand why, but it's missing a lot of content, among other issues. For example, the \"One Punch Man\" title only comtains the 1st season and it's labeled as season 2. I like to binge full series, so even if there weren't organizational issues, I'm not really satisfied with a small taste of a great anime when I can find the whole thing elsewhere.","I downloaded this app yesterday, it was amazing, it doesnt have all the animes you expect but it has a lot of nice ones. It also doesnt have ads and it doesnt lagg a lot. Today I tried to watch something but it said that its an error. One hour later I redownloaded it again and it didnt let me log in saying its an error. I need help what can I do?","Great app, handy to have on the go and easy enough to use. There are a few problems though: 1. There seems to be a labelling difference between the app anf the site as many series are labelled or named wrong (eg: the English sub of 86 is named as season 2 for some reason). 2. The synchronisation between the animation and the text really messes up at times, especially for older series, there may be a 5 second delay between animationnand sound.

That is not enough time, and to automatically start charging your Google Play account, I thought this app had a free version. I can't get to the free version. What ever happened to \"try before you buy? Edit: OK, it is possible to kill both\" free trial offer\" screens and try the app, just a lot of ads. I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate. A free trial means you don't need to do anything to use it, including making an effort to subscribe. UPD: sorry, my bad. Didn't notice the X button.

The arrival/ departure times for CTA trains could be a bit clearer. Think Ventra app. Has a comprehensive selection of bus and rail routes but the time displays are difficult to understand. Having a list of departure / arrival times would help tremendously. All in all a good transit reference app and I like it. I'll give it more stars when I get used to it.","This is a good app, but resent update that brought ads just horrible. Ads that jump at me right when I press the button to start a bus ride, when I need to scan a QR code on the bus station and get in the bus I get a full screen pop up. Your decision just forced me to move to other app. Good luck with this. I was loyal user but for now I am out.","The app can be very helpful, but arrival times can be a bit off which can be annoying if you don't plan around it. Another big problem I have with the app is that it's downright unusable when in dark mode. Many elements of the UI don't properly transition to a brighter color when in dark mode and are unreadable, and switching back to light mode is annoying. All and all I would say the app is a4/5 on light mode and a 1/5 on dark mode","I've enjoyed this app for years over my local government's attempt at an app, but the advertisements have become a problem. When it's crunch time and you need to check on buses with a sense of urgency, having a full page ad (usually of another map app?? WHY??) that has to load, then be exited, has actually screwed me several times.","So confusing to look at all I want to do is search for and find out a bus time, it's just far too fussy,. Update Developer response saying this is in the lines tab. How would I be expected to know that? . I am looking for a bus time / route. I know nothing about bus lines and which services they operate. A simple search box with destination and from would suffice, just as when I book a train."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tranzmate","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tranzmate&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Simple Radio – Free Live AM FM Radio & Music App","description":"📻 Simple Radio by Streema is the easiest way to tune in to your favorite FM radio, AM radio & online radio stations.

A complete charged battery (4750mAh) drains off within 6 hours. Didn't have this problem before. For this reason I give only two stars. Solve the problem and I will rate it with five stars 😉 Update 26th July 2021: It looks like the issue is fixed. 5 stars for a top app!","Doesn't have the most popular radio stations this it's not really a radio app, it's a BS app. Uninstalled. One-starred. Laughed about non-app. Middle finger to the screen. Telling every single person I speak with, stranger or acquaintance that Simple Radio sucks, even if the conversation is completely unrelated. I will say this to every single person I interact with. If I meet someone new that'll be the first thing I tell them. I have never done this with any app. It sucks that much.","Love this app, I use it all the time! However there is one problem :^: .... My station (particularly the Jazz Radio station in Lyon Rhode Alps in France keeps cutting out, even though it says it's playing. If I try to pause and play it again, the whole app shuts down. Please fix it, I really love this app and my jazz 🙏 Edit: fixed!!! Thank you!!","I've enjoyed using it..... For the first month I had it. Been using it for almost a year and I'm getting real tired of the random closing. I'll be listening to the radio and I'll have a 4 or 5 bar signal and my station stops. So I have to unlock my phone and restart the station to continue listening. I listen to talk radio a lot so I get to miss out on important talks because of random closures. And the app has been patched many times and it still does it. So obviously it isn't a priority.","AGAIN: STATION loses connection. UPDATE: HAPPENING AGAIN!! STILL STOPPING! WHEN GOING TO FIX? FIRE YOUR AD PERSON. The developer Has REPETITIVELY FAILED to fix the APP & it the app stops multiple times in as short as 15 minutes..

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask?

Thank you.","I've been using the Waze app for about 5 years now and I really like it although I was using an older version 4.68.0.1 due to bugs in other versions. I am also using a old phone LG K20+ that still works with even the newest version 4.76.1.3 I'm making a 511 mile trip on Wednesday to visit family. I'll see how well the newest features on the new version work. Wish me luck.. 😬 P.S. I know where I'm going and how to get there.
