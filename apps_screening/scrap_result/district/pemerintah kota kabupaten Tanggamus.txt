I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all.

I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static. Still, it's great for people who use wired headphones. I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","The app work fine but when you quit an app it's notification keeps persistent for a couple of seconds.

This help me alot in my difficult situations.

If you solve this problem then there to nothing to say any negative point of this application. Thanks.","The ads make this app very creepy. Like you are such an invasive friend and a terrible one if you use this app to check on your friends when they say \"oh battery's dead\" or something. That's creepy. Plus half the things you say in the ad doesn't make sense. Any way you advertise this app is just gonna make it look creepy and kinda stalkerish. Other than that, your replys to most of these reviews are quite nice.","Zenly is a very cool app. I used it every day. After that, I updated the firmware version and now it does not work ... Endless loading on the background of ice cream (after registration and delivery of all permissions). I really want to use it, but I can't anymore... Waiting for help! 🆘","The app is perfect and one thing they should fix is battery optimization if you could add something like sleeping mode which will freeze the location untill we turn it off again. so that battery would not drain faster at that time","At first it was ok, when I update the apps suddenly cannot locate the loaction and its not accurate.

Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","First, I'm consistently taken to places that are not there (looking for Ace Hardware in Boulder CO, sent me to Ball industries) 2nd, the initial directions and distance given are vastly different from when you engage the drive aspect of app. My last major issue: Unlike most other nav apps, this one does not display the address of the location you've arrived at, so when I reach a job (I'm an electrician) I have to go back to the text sent by the customer to find the precise location/address.","This app is mostly designed for outside the USA. You fight with getting everything non-metric but then when you route a trip, the distance is again in metric. Plus, what's with the icon? It has that same Google looking confusing blue fan thing trying to indicate what direction you are facing. Is it suppose to be in front of you or behind you??? How about a simple arrow? How hard would that be? It's just as confusing as Google Map's icon. If you are in England or somewhere similar, go ahead and try this. For us American users, it's as useless as a screen door on a submarine and I'm uninstalling with extreme prejudice.","Don't buy this product, it use to be good with good service. I bought it with the premium package with free maps. Then when their new premium combined package comes out, I could not use my sygic navigation in Chicago. Their help was to buy the newer premium package with fewer map renewals. And pay literally the same $40.00. That is out acceptable.","I want to like the app but to me it has two bad short comings. I have trouble seeing the maps because I have bifocals. U am too close to see with the far vision and too far to see with the reading so I need voice. That brings me to the second one. I am not paying 55 bucks a year for voice instructions. I don't want the rest of what comes with a subscription. You should offer voice at a lower price, except you withheld that so people would pay for premium. I also hate the premium nag ad."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Waplog - Dating App to Chat & Meet New People","description":"Waplog Dating App\r\n\r\nThe fastest-growing dating app with more than 90 million users worldwide.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

If you’re starting to think that there are things beyond farming, put your farm sim on hold and start building your town that will gradually become a city, and then a megapolis with the best airport in the world!

To make your travels memorable, you can bring back rare artifacts and unique collections. See how many souvenirs can fit in one aircraft!\r\nBut it’s not just a flight simulator—you’ll have to apply your outstanding management skills to develop all the supporting infrastructure too, in one of the most amazing airport games! Take care of the entire city next to it, to provide your airport all the required services.\r\n\r\nIf what you’re looking for in city building games is peaceful gameplay and interactions, this city simulator is exactly what you need.

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"WorldCraft: 3D Build & Block Craft","description":"★Welcome to WorldCraft - Best Crafting and Building 2020 Game Played by Thousands of Players ★\r\nPLAY NOW free creative online multiplayer games or survival exploration games.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Opera News: Breaking Local & US Headlines","description":"We’re proud to be enjoyed and trusted by over 350 million global users.
