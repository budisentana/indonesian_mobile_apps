Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going. They need to fix that but is something I could live with it. Using Google pixel 5","I've read through your support forums. Can't find answers. Issue started Aug 2nd. All features work except sms.

I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static. Still, it's great for people who use wired headphones. I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","The app work fine but when you quit an app it's notification keeps persistent for a couple of seconds.

A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little. But they slowed the car like WAY too much.","It's an okay game. It would be better though if it didn't give you THE SAME CARS when you use cash for them. The more you get cars the more it happens. Not only that but when you hit an oil tank truck and it blows up you fall through the ground instead of landing back down. The tanks are unnecessarily overpowered they shoot at you and flip you then you get back up and flip again over over until you get wrecked!","This game is very fun, unfortunately, the time amount of time it takes to get arrested varies and the game does glitch.

Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Waplog - Dating App to Chat & Meet New People","description":"Waplog Dating App\r\n\r\nThe fastest-growing dating app with more than 90 million users worldwide.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful.

All access number based calls use the standard minutes from your cell phone plan and may incur costs (e.g. when traveling internationally).","summary":"A customizable phone number in the cloud","installs":"10,000,000+","minInstalls":10000000,"maxInstalls":28269617,"score":4.2501874,"scoreText":"4.3","ratings":266611,"reviews":90105,"histogram":{"1":26575,"2":7630,"3":15309,"4":40097,"5":176998},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"Varies with device","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"Google LLC","developerId":"5700313618786177705","developerEmail":"apps-help@google.com","developerWebsite":"http://www.google.com/voice","developerAddress":"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043","privacyPolicy":"http://www.google.com/policies/privacy","developerInternalID":"5700313618786177705","genre":"Communication","genreId":"COMMUNICATION","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Gf8ufuFbtfXO5Y6JuZjnG0iIpZh21zNTqZ5aiAXO8mA38mvXzY-1s27FWbGlp51paQ","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YAcWQVBN8tcl5swm5qEeuwP8zMUNXRd6E0yN_gEVn4lYX7ern9S_4VZqRI6DeRhidw","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-Eo8pCXJ9ofkZsS605-4uXBXbOjCLMOI2THcPhTlmmJ5AUtOlV_ejWpwmxdnobwg-xg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/T_6aiD-fKmn91V8Hqm2WNGlxQfonKKfUm9u0pQBzsgg29QFnszI0tCcKLLwl3TDQtG0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yTSD6lM63edhAl0bhQdKiE9hC7OIHgzBxMX2PSnwlW248e7GHvsjgZjIuuhicvMsnAjP","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aIRH5E41KH1pNSsWfHgU7i02_UHDFYSG621aS9Rc-OBjLStfeTEyRJIzOQp6Ncojbz8","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rJrkcEsdQa7_AozmzGpy9CPTy-GKKFENfBRdUQwXLdI0tSbYSMsng0C19CdzYmQM-Q","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/iWaKOLYdmOKqLObx3EkBc71BPdkUdNNC__ry6E7rcznxj4CfD6gdcPCnbUJqfa1rnOY"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"updated":1627324235000,"version":"2021.07.12.384316411","recentChanges":"• Support for marking group messages as spam.<br>  • Stability and performance improvements","comments":["Google voice is by far the best free app i have ever used. I've been using it for several years now & it has been extremely reliable. I can p/u any ph & immediately set up my ph number to it in conjunction with any other numbers being used. I can log in to any computer, pull up my ph number & immediately start using it as well. There are many other features too. Just an all around great app.","I've been using Google Voice for over 5 years (prior to and after the 'merge' with Hangouts). It gives me the freedom to make calls and texts over IP/WiFi or thru my phone plan. If I'm sitting at my computer I can call or answer in my browser. The biggest issue I've had with Voice is its lack of integration with Google Contacts. It maintains its own contact list and will not search my Contacts. Hey Google! Can you add a 'Use Google Contacts' option so Voice can search and sync with Contacts?","Mostly work as intended. One really annoying problems though: when new messages come in, the notification bar blocks the text input field. tapping anywhere on the screen will just make the notification bar last longer. You literally have to stare at the screen and wait for it to disappear to start typing again, until the next new message comes in, wait for another 3 seconds. Please fix this.","I've been using gv for years and right now it's on my Galaxy S20 FE phone. For the past week or two, though, any calls to/from my gv number aren't working right. When someone calls my gv number, I can't hear them and they cannot hear me. The same thing happens when I call them using the gv app to place the call. I uninstalled the app, rebooted my phone and reinstalled the app and gv worked to receive one call - it worked perfectly. But every call afterwards was the same as before: I can't hear the caller and the caller cannot hear me. The same when I place a call. I have also reset the app data and cache and again: it works for one call and then not again.","I've enjoyed Google and the Voice app for quite some time. On June 28 I was prompted to update my Voice app and did so. After that I've been unable to make calls or send texts. This renders the app unusable. Yikes! I gave it three stars because it's been great until now... Any help or ideas on how to fix this are welcome."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.googlevoice","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googlevoice&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"SKOUT - Meet, Chat, Go Live","description":"Instantly meet people near you or around the world!

I just hope this problem cam be fixed as soon as possible. and i want to recover my first account as i have a lot of important contacts there. please do something about it. thank youtso much!","There's always something wrong with this app. New update version doesn't even load the persons profile I'm trying to view. Just shows a blank screen, photos don't load. This has been going on for months. Can't even message someone because their profile page won't load. This app is ridiculous. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Get rid of the new update!, Can't view anyone's profile!","Use to be a handy recource when \"old mate\" was out of town or you felt like indulging in sometime of a different pace. Now it's just rubbish since they took the buzz away. #bringbackthebuzz!! For those that missed it - it once had a feature called the buzz. It was like fb's news feed. Except all the updates were what the vendor is selling \"meth in South Yarra, $xx for 1gram\" or \"puff, juice and pills. All night. Hmu\". Best thing it's all local- WAS all local. Now there's no one. And no drugs","The last update brought A LOT of bugs that need to be fixed, I could get on before but it would take forever to load at login, takes forever to load someone's profile pictures and profile and it switches your profile picture if you have multiple pictures on your profile. FIX IT IMMEDIATELY DEVS!","Profiles won't load properly. Pics won't load on profile pages. Cant see the thumbs but they never upload to poeples profiles. I see here this is happening to other people too. So why hasn't this been fixed. You have an unusable app that's been like that for months.
