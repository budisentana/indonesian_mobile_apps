But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Baby Panda Home Safety","description":"Home is a special place.

I'm now waiting a month at a time to simply expand my village and that's all I CAN do.

Would b 5 stars if it weren't for that.","Hi I'm Giving this a two star 🌟 only because now when I play in collecting my coins and stuff and doing what I have to do to level up but once in a few minutes maybe seconds I get ads It will stop and then give me another one and it's just not worth the hassle for me so please explain why I'm getting ads? Or does anyone else gets ads great game I love it just the ads are annoying","Amazing game, but a little bit expensive. Anyways, the only improvement I need is that I want the things I buy to already have their permanent places because moving them is a hassle and I do not like unorganized things so...😬","it's a money pit after around 50 90% of animals you have to use acorns which you have to buy. you only have about 12 toys for the critters to play, decoration is not much better, I think once you buy in the VIP club you get more animals and decorating and toys. all they want is more money . It stopped giving the free acorns.

Can't search the exact content, but pushing many under quality videos, it is like a promoted channel. I tried now several times to edit settings, same result. Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included . This will limit their use on mobile ."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"The Survival Hunter Games 2","description":"The game comes fully loaded with amazing features!

This game is a MAJOR improvement that splintered off the first one. The graphics are great and the shaders were a great choice. 2.

You can't search within a podcast so you have to scroll until you find the one you want and since they are ordered from new to old, if you let it play automatically, it'll play \"in reverse\" (i.e. Part 2 would play before Part 1.) and every now and then, instead of staying the next episode, it'll go back to the top and play the latest.","When it works nothing beats it but lately it is worst than Sirus.....which is bad. Cuts out every half song...then I wait about 5 minutes and some times it comes back but mostly I need to stop the song and restart it. Very frustrating when trying to get a tan on a beach. The web site on the computer is #1.... but the app for the phone is a big ZERO.","I totally love this app!!! It works good, but there are two problems with it. There are too many ads and also I also had trouble for some time keeping the Bluetooth connection when I open the app and play a radio station or podcast or anything on the app. I know there is nothing wrong with me Bluetooth speaker. My speakers are fully charged and I can play everything else on it. Can you please look into it?","I used to enjoy this app more in the beginning but now not so much. I could add and delete songs and it would only play the songs I added. Now you can't delete any songs and it plays random songs not added by me. Also you can't add any Garth Brooks songs. I even tried the free trial for premium and still no luck. I tried to listen to Garth Brooks radio with unlimited skips and I heard one song from him and skipped over 50 times and nothing. I am currently looking into other music options.","Commercials, Commercials, Commercials! If you like Commercials, then this is the app for you. Every time I use the app, I have to FIRST LISTEN TO FIFTEEN COMMERCIALS before I actually get to the station. I upgraded to the plus service, but to no avail. I'm giving it two stars because after you manage to listen to all of the Commercials, it actually does what it should."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Babyphone - baby music games with Animals, Numbers","description":"Educational animal games for preschoolers - baby phone.\r\nBaby games Phone for Kids is one of our baby educational games for kids  which entertains babies and helps them learn 123 numbers, animals and sounds for babies.

Last month I'm send email costumer care but still not reply this related. I suggest you Please provide 3 months coin package. 6 months coin package. and yearly coin package related every time is not possible buying coin better than one time every one buying coin and enjoy life and please reduce buying coin prices. I think you understand and don't ignore my suggestion. Thanks regards 😊","This app has everything thing I want. No VIP before u can chat, free and instant messages! The interface is really good. It's an overall social app, you should download cuz u won't be dissapointed!","I don't have to rate this app because, at first everything was going perfectly fine and suddenly I was banned 🚫 from using the app so ihad to delete my waplog account to create another thinking it was a technical fault, but creating another I was banned 🚫 as well and I created another hopping not to give up, still it got worse so I gave up and immediately I deleted the application","I really appreciate sharing ideas and experiences on this platform, it really lovely and wonderful I really love it.."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.waplog.social","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waplog.social&hl=en&gl=us"}]
