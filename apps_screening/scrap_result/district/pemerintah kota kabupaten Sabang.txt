Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GPS Route Finder : Maps Navigation & Directions","description":"GPS Route Finder : Maps Navigation & Directions provides variety of features such as GPS shortest Route finder, Driving route , Current Location, Maps Navigation, GPS Area Calculator, Distance Calculator, International subscriber dialing (ISD) or Country Codes, City Codes (STD) codes(USA, India, Pakistan), Altitude meter & more - make everything simple and easy! \r\n\r\nGPS Route Finder use GPS & Network to get your position on Map, Helps you Navigate Freely on maps and get you required directions.

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Mobile Strike","description":"Become an action hero like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the new game of modern war - ¬†Mobile Strike!

It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!!

YouTube Music must have every song üéµ in the world!! And eventually if you hit the like button often enough they will create a list of just your favorite songs/videos. I pay for YouTube premium and I'm sure that's why I don't get any ads at all. I'm very üòä happy with YouTube Music so far.","This app is alright. I have premium, so I can't comment of the ads. The functions for listening to songs are quite good. However, ocationaly on songs it will say they are from a different artist, or play a song to what it says and what the album cover is. For example, when I went into thefatrat's \"Rise up\" it played a song called solitude instead. This was later fixed, however, if I go to the song, \"Kings and Queens Part two\" by Ava Max, it will sometimes play the wrong song.","The radio option is the only thing I really don't like about it. When you selected \"radio\" on an artist in Google play music it played songs that were from similar artists. YTM however, seems to play songs from artists that you've listened to a lot. Example: Hit the radio button on a power metal artist and the radio starts playing a bunch of TOOL because I've listened to them a lot and it really doesn't fit at all, especially when I'm using it to explore other artists in the power metal genre.","Not fit for purpose. I've been trying to work with this junk since launch. Spent months creating 12 playlists across 12 genres, totalling 9,170 tracks to listen to my playlists across my 7 Google hub max speakers. However, regardless of what playlist you select, even on shuffle, it will always start off playing the first track. It will then continue to play the same 20 or 30 tracks over and over again all day long even when playlist has over 1000 tracks. Switched to Spotify yesterday, heaven!!","I enjoy using the app. It creates several Mixes for you from different genres & eras that you listen to so you can choose what you're in the mood for. Every Wednesday there's a Discover Mix which I love. It's a mix of music they think you'll like based on your music choices. I'd give it 5 stars, but they took away the tab that used to drop down with your task bar. That was great bc you could skip through songs without leaving the app you're currently in.

I think about half of the players have stopped playing now. What the developers haven't seen, is that if the spenders don't have anyone who doesn't spend to compete with, they won't have to spend as much to get the same rewards, so the game developers wi get less money I hope this change is reverted soon. Thanks.","Decided to play game with friends and family, only to find out moving servers is a total loss (monies already spent and game money in my account) and I would have to start all over. Has been completely disappointing and never a response from games customer support. Don't waste money on this game as can clearly see they do not listen players and have no concern for them. I suggest looking for something more player friendly. Can see how they created empire by stealing from players.","One has to pay too high a price in real dollar$ and game coins for what you're needing to advance while playing this game. I also learned the hard way, that you have very little chance against Ruby players who are unethical bullies, whether they are players and/or Alliances. There's no recourse when players and Alliances do not follow the rules of the game. Also, why can't you play the game without downloading the updates?","After I updated the game it was demanding update again. so I deleted and installed the app to get rid of the bug. Since I couldn't remember my password I requested a password change but I noticed the game server is also changed and my progress is gone. The game can also be laggy most of the times. It is a good old game but not suitable for modern times and it has very bad bugs. most of players are inactive.","It's a good game overall, except when ever the game has it's bugs... Which seems to happen A LOT.... But what surprised me the most, was that this company gave me my money back. This review used to be vary different, I complained about losing money by buying some stuff and not getting it...

That is not enough time, and to automatically start charging your Google Play account, I thought this app had a free version. I can't get to the free version. What ever happened to \"try before you buy? Edit: OK, it is possible to kill both\" free trial offer\" screens and try the app, just a lot of ads. I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate.

Once they started a promotion that caught my eye I entered my credit card, and was hit with an \"error\" as soon as the purchase went through. They took my money and gave me nothing in return, I contacted them multiple times and received automated responses. Don't install but if you do DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY MONEY UNLESS YOU CONSIDER IT A DONATION. Below you'll see an example of an automated response.","Do not play this game, and please do not spend any money on it. They are thieves! Looked interesting, so I started to play, and bought one of their packs. The pack gliched out. I was quick enough to even get a screen shot, however when I tried contacting the support group they never responded. Left several messages over the course of a week. All unanswered. Don't let them scam you next... So they respond telling me to contact them, I did, multiple times. Still no help!","Simple suggestion. When you kick me from your game for \"no internet connection\" even though I clearly have an internet connection then force me to close your game in order for your app to recognize I clearly have a connection how about not stealing all my character HP. Just some food for thought guys. Don't see the sense in why you'd vampire all my HP for closing the game you force me to close","I have been patient with this game, and hoping that someone would be able to help me with this game freezing up. I can't even finish a pvp fight anymore. I have to restart this game repeatedly to accomplish anything. I even tried spending a few bucks hoping that my issue would be resolved sooner.","Earlier review -Worst, Game suddenly existing, freezing, no internet issue problem, very slow. Now - Still same issue, can't even play with these issues. Everytime in just 5 minutes , this game existing and other different issue like loading, not internet connection error, wwe champions require an internet connection to play error, freezing error.

Thank you for playing Thomas &amp; Friends: Go Go Thomas","comments":["Bought the full package to open everything on my main account for the kids. However when logging in it still shows that everything is still locked. This is due to I have 2 Google accounts on my phone and the app realized that I didn't pay on the other so it won't unlock until I remove the other account. This is dissapointing since paying a stupid amount to unlock full features for the kids is sad enough. Now I have to remove then add my other account back on everytime my kids played the game.","What a perfect app. Best for Thomas Train racing . We need to pay for buying packs and other engines! Why? Please make those free and make a option of coins so that every pack/engine will be unlocked by the amount of coins you earned? Please put it. That's why 2 star(s) is missing. THANK YOU. And I have changed my phone but still you have not changed anything. Please fix it.","My son loves this game and so do I. The only addition I am thinking of is maybe listing the engine names at the pre race screen to help him associate the spelling of the names with the pronunciation and engine. Loved Thomas and friends when I was young and now I get to enjoy it with him. Hey, who do I talk to about bringing back Rheneas and Skarloey?","I am very disappointed by the in-app purchase mechanism of this game. I purchased the game for my nephew using his Play Store email profile on my mobile phone. The reason for doing this is to ensure that I have the purchase credentials on my phone. That didnt work.

It's really a great game. Rephrase that. If money wasn't the top priority this app would be so awesome for all consumers to enjoy. If u don't have 100 bucks a week to spend at the least. Don't play ffxv.","You can play free to play but its made so that some items are only available for a limited time or never and if you miss them you have to wait until they are offered as a prize months later. The p2p players can gift others a catch up token which often includes things past the paywall which is nice. Its a war game much much more than a city building one. Tries to get you to spend $. And different pack offers based on spending tier.","This game is legitimate garbage. All it does is drag the final fantasy name through the mud. You try and play and just get one tapped by someone 2 levels above you since they love balancing to make players spend money. If you don't spend or know people who will help you by spending than you're not gonna go anywhere. The support, sorry \"support\" actually told me when I have issues its my fault. I asked about the scaling of their events. They said its only for high levels spend money. GG Greed","I give it 5 stars cause it has helped me thru very tough times. Being able to talk communicate and strategize with other players. Never experienced anything like it. I was able to stay out of trouble and to better my life at same time. We all experience difficulties on buying packs. But truthfully I'm seeing people that has not spent money are hardly any catch up to the rest of us that do spend regularly.This is why buying the empire boosts are a must.This is what makes you better. GOD bless","0/10 Would not recommend. Pros: If you don't value your time and money, Congratulations you are the target audience for this game. Cons: 1) A window pops-up every 10 seconds telling you to spend money and you can't tell it to go away for the day like some other games with a similar pop-up. 2) The game doesn't really have anything to do with FF. They just took a poorly made game and through-in some pngs of ffXV characters.

The game worked fine in the past and this sucks cause no matter what I do the black screen happens when I open the game everytime and I also made purchases in the past so that makes its suck even more. Fix the game please, I know it's an update issue cause I've played this on my s10 in the past with no problems. It's a great game will change my rating as soon as the game is actually fixed.","Everything about this game is good, but two things that really annoy me are... 1. There is no back button in the game to exit things like the upgrade sections, I always have to exit the entire game to restart an get to the menu where I can go to races. 2. You only get one gold per level up, even if it's a higher level, the only thing about leveling up is getting gold so it takes the reward out of it, I thought maybe you could progessively get more gold the higher the level you achieve.","It goes black screen again and again, I tried installing and uninstalling it so many times still the same thing happens. My phone has 50gb free space with an 8gb+3gb extended ram with a 720g snapdragon processor. I can play csr2 with my phone but not with this one. Please let me know how to fix this","Used to love this game. Went to go download it on my Galaxy A51 after not playing it for about 3 years. When I load the game after installing it asks for storage permissions and then force closes. After relaunching it shows the Natural motion logo then blackscreens. Once I can play the game again I will change my rating.","It's literally the best drag racing game ever on play store and app store!

Very one dimensional. Got tired of falling behind on every launch on 'DRIVERS BATTLE' despite following all the indicators and getting 'perfect launch' message, so I guess I will just not play anymore. If your car isn't maxed for it's level, 'DRIVERS BATTLE' is the only way to grind currency, and it gets old in minutes. The devs have been jacking off for the last what, 7 years now? I think I'll just download hill climb, or better yet, just stare at the wall. thanks for nothing","Disappointed... Back then when this game cannot connect the data to Google Play Games, they help me to recover the lost profile. Then after play it for a loooong time, they upgraded the game so it can connect saved data to Google Play Games. Now they reset it, my old profile built with hours and hours of play...... disappeared.. And the simple game becomes very complicated..","Disappointing game.
