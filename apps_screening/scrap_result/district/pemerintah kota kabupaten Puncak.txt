What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth!

Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building. It also have military, airport, railway, minerals, space oruented,....etc 3.In each and every places has unique song i really have enjoyed it. 4.

It's really a great game. Rephrase that. If money wasn't the top priority this app would be so awesome for all consumers to enjoy. If u don't have 100 bucks a week to spend at the least. Don't play ffxv.","You can play free to play but its made so that some items are only available for a limited time or never and if you miss them you have to wait until they are offered as a prize months later. The p2p players can gift others a catch up token which often includes things past the paywall which is nice. Its a war game much much more than a city building one. Tries to get you to spend $. And different pack offers based on spending tier.","This game is legitimate garbage. All it does is drag the final fantasy name through the mud. You try and play and just get one tapped by someone 2 levels above you since they love balancing to make players spend money. If you don't spend or know people who will help you by spending than you're not gonna go anywhere. The support, sorry \"support\" actually told me when I have issues its my fault. I asked about the scaling of their events. They said its only for high levels spend money. GG Greed","I give it 5 stars cause it has helped me thru very tough times. Being able to talk communicate and strategize with other players. Never experienced anything like it. I was able to stay out of trouble and to better my life at same time. We all experience difficulties on buying packs. But truthfully I'm seeing people that has not spent money are hardly any catch up to the rest of us that do spend regularly.This is why buying the empire boosts are a must.This is what makes you better. GOD bless","0/10 Would not recommend. Pros: If you don't value your time and money, Congratulations you are the target audience for this game. Cons: 1) A window pops-up every 10 seconds telling you to spend money and you can't tell it to go away for the day like some other games with a similar pop-up. 2) The game doesn't really have anything to do with FF. They just took a poorly made game and through-in some pngs of ffXV characters.

Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Sygic GPS Navigation & Offline Maps","description":"Sygic GPS, Navigation is the world‚Äôs most downloaded Offline GPS navigation app, trusted by more than 200 million drivers.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features.

It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game.

U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week.

However, i have given it 4 stars because of a glitch that i do not know how to fix. I have made two custom characters, but I can only get one to appear at a time. one will appear, but when i edit the other one so it appears as well the first one vanishes, and can't be found under the stop sign menu. in addition, there are a lot, and i mean a lot of in app purchases, and there is almost nothing for free to play users.","Toca world is an Amazing game! It is full of imagination and creativity. It is a good game for children about the age 6-11. I have played Toca games for about 5 years now and I'm still not bored of it. For a start, when I first played Toca games I loved them! And so when Toca World came out I wanted to play it so bad because all the games were mixed together. For the positives, It doesn't have many ads at all. For the Negatives, you have to pay to expand your world which isn't much of a problem.","I love this app! And the new stuff! But this review Is not mine but is gonna be for my friend. She made a schoolhouse last night or something, Next day (which is today) everything disappeared... Some stuff are not available to get anymore :(. Like she lost the backpack from the gift which is not available anymore (I think?) I really wanna help her out but I dont know how. Soooooo the only way to fix this was telling it in a review! I dont know how you can help but... This was worth it ^_^","There are few complaints I need to make sure get patched. 1, I make 2 characters in the creator. As soon as I go to the floogle place, it only gives me only one character. 2.

That is not enough time, and to automatically start charging your Google Play account, I thought this app had a free version. I can't get to the free version. What ever happened to \"try before you buy? Edit: OK, it is possible to kill both\" free trial offer\" screens and try the app, just a lot of ads. I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate.

You can get everything in the game + no ads for only 5 bucks which is pretty good.","I have a suggestion. since I have bought all the maps and cars, I have been playing for a long time. I decided there should be a sandbox mode in the game and that you build and create your own map and use your own imagination to set your map up and you can save the map and name what even you like.

Noooo!...&quot; CRACK!<br>...<br>&quot;I rode my bike along West twenty-seventh street and then it jumped out right from the ground! Dunno what it is but it&#39;s BIG!

","comments":["This reminds me of a game called GRABATRON. But with that game, you control a ufo that picks up the people and vehicles. This is a little hard to control, but it's good. It's supposed to be that way. This game has a lot to offer. I can't do the minigames like make the worm go through a hoop, like 18 hoops in 2 minutes. I am lucky to get 8 of them in 2 minutes. Or bump the crates to make them hit the enemies. I am lucky if i can even bump the crates. I would like it if it had more sounds.","SUPER COOL,but as much as i hate to say it,theres a problem!It need energy to play missions and stuf and when run out energy and ads.you can play!so it makes it worse please cancel energy bc i ruin all th fun.üëíüòîüòÉ","Constant Push for Microtransactions. Makes me feel like I'm also an enraged worm but I'll uninstall to avoid the stress. Seriously guys. This is bs","UPDATE; July 29th, 2021~What happened to the Epic Growl? Now you have the big jump Or whatever its called which doesnt work at all. Please put back EPIC GROWL , IT WAS BEST EFFECT EVER and please make fireballs free so game is more enjoyable instead of having to watch ads constantly and only play game in between ads. Also i notice right after you give me 6 fireballs the game ends and this happens alot, so why dont my fireballs come with me to next round? That would be fair since i have either","Really fun games! I even can play it offline and the app size is small. But for me the worm's movement control a bit \"wild\" and too fast. But again this game have nice concept and i love how kind you developer answers all of the review.

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little. But they slowed the car like WAY too much."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rkgames.smashywanted","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rkgames.smashywanted&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PlayKids - Cartoons, Books and Educational Games","description":"Children learn to read, watch videos, and read ebooks.
