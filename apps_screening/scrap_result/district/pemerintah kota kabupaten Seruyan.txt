Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask?

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful.

Basic service (free) requires a reset every 30 days. You hardly notice it's there. It is slightly cumbersome to use at first shot. After session expires, you definitely know by SPAM calls comng through. This service should be compulsory for AT&T to provide. It has more value than free HBO or insurance. App deserves 5 Stars. I give it 3 because it's not free and should be.","Can't believe this isn't installed by default. Further, charging me $4 a month for full spam support seems opportunistic. Seems like spam calls should be something AT&T and other service providers should we working to stop, not squander more money away from their users. Definitely going to research which provide offers the best complete spam coverage without additional cost when choosing my next phone company","Too many Terms And Conditilns and riff raff. Just make things simple without asking for our first born. It says it blocks, but does not. Callers are still able to leave messages and text.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"World Building Craft","description":"World Building Craft is #1 sandbox block world crafting simulator.

I just wish that casted podcasts would play at the increased playback speed.","Amazing app. The app UI sleek and straightforward, eliminating distracting clutter, and overall has a good feel to it. Although, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about my experience with podcasts in general. This app helped me fall in love with fiction audio dramas, which is a medium I wasn't expecting to enjoy. I can listen while driving or cooking, or I can just sit back and let my eyes focus on nothing in particular. Overall, my experience has been phenomenal.","Really like this app, especially the ability to speed up podcasts in 10% increments, unlike other apps which use increments of 25%. Two things that would make this perfect: 1. Additional functionality in the playlist like a multi-select feature and move to top/bottom option. 2. Ability to rewind/forward from the lock screen widget instead of having to unlock it every time. If forward is disabled for advertisers then at least give us the ability to rewind.","I use it daily. Player shows as 2 different apps in recent apps, which is a weird bug. Variety of other issues but nothing too major. Downloads/play only seem to work for rather recent pods, and if you find some interesting stuff from say 2012, they won't download or play for some reason. Crashes have become less frequent (thanks devs!). Still my go to for podcasts. Submitted as requested. Can't get pic of the 2 instances showing up as it's doing it in android itself when bringing up recentapps","Google pixel 2 - using app for 3 yrs - app feedback/ bug reports don't seem to be helping. Since the addition of a queue a while back (was much needed), I always download and add episodes to my queue simultaneously. Now, episodes are randomly removed from the queue and cannot be re-added (they remain in downloads but the \"add to queue\" flashes green and then back to blue). Not to mention the second instance which appears as a blank screen in the apps list any time you open the app. Needs work."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.podcasts","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.podcasts&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ben 10: Alien Experience","description":"Battle the bad guys in augmented reality and turn your selfies into Ben 10’s aliens with the Ben 10 Alien Experience!\r\n\r\nIMMERSIVE AR BATTLES\r\nUse augmented reality to surround yourself with 360 degrees of action!
