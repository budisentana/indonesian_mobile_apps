They are both on yet it doesn't track. Thinking of finding another GPS tracker since this been failing a couple of times.","Easy to use. Accurate. Can give a street view even as to where your loved one might be. Makes me feel more secure that family can see where I am at.","Works great on rare occasions might not be accurate by a block, but if it's a common place u should be fine.

How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home. So, instead of just opening the tracker in another browser tab, the developers in their infinite wisdom have decided that it is better if you unlock your phone, open the app, and then be able to locate. What a DUMB decision :-( PLEASE rethink this!","Great for finding lost phones and keeping an eye on loved ones.

Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2.

A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"WWE","description":"Download the WWE app for:\r\n- WWE news and announcements\r\n- The latest results from every pay-per-view, Raw, SmackDown and NXT\r\n- WWE Superstar profiles and title histories\r\n- Access to live event tickets and official WWE merchandise","descriptionHTML":"Download the WWE app for:<br>- WWE news and announcements<br>- The latest results from every pay-per-view, Raw, SmackDown and NXT<br>- WWE Superstar profiles and title histories<br>- Access to live event tickets and official WWE merchandise","summary":"Download the WWE app for the latest news, announcements, results and more!","installs":"10,000,000+","minInstalls":10000000,"maxInstalls":37855133,"score":4.487771,"scoreText":"4.5","ratings":787944,"reviews":228708,"histogram":{"1":58620,"2":14655,"3":27795,"4":69567,"5":617305},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$9.99 per item","size":"18M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"WWE, Inc.","developerId":"WWE,+Inc.","developerEmail":"appfeedback@wwe.com","developerWebsite":"https://www.wwe.com","developerAddress":"1241 E.

As a WWE lifer, I am extremely disappointed.

It will do the job but make you hate yourself for it. The interface is very heavy feeling and at times a pain to navigate. Its like trying to take a detour with no signs. They have catagories... sorta, but I am convinced it was just a program vomiting content after a night of cheap liquor. It has the vibe of a designed team that remember their assignment 3 hours before the deadline. Bring a GPS you're going to need it to find your way around.","More adds than video content. Often the videos fail, but don't worry the advertisements never do. If you try to rewatch a 10 second clip that recently failed, you'll have to watch the advertisement again, which never fails to run. Unacceptable for a company as large as it is, and owned by Disney. Get it together boys and girls....You should be better than this. I pay a monthly subscription for this, rediculous!","Incredibly terrible app for this size company. Load times are awful, there are 30 second unskippable commercials that freeze, so you wait 2 minutes to watch 25 seconds of content followed by more commercials. The watch app is terrible, I have espn+ membership but I'm unable to watch games that are on broadcast television like ABC, because I don't have a cable membership. Their watch section is laid out terribly and it's vague what you are able to watch with your membership. So bad.","If it weren't a dang monopoly, I would've deleted this app years ago. Slow load times, has no problem loading 40 second ads, but then won't load the 10 second highlight you came to see. But wait, try to find the highlight anywhere else, and it'll kick you back to their app. Please, for the love of God, can yahoo, or fox sports, or literally anyone make a half decent app for sports. I'll take it over this dumpster fire any day","Horrible lag in the app. Also it does a horrendous job playing videos. The big issue is the handoff from ad to content. And even when the video is playing, of you change the time on the video, it won't respond and will skip the video. Would have expected a lot more from a big company, bit the app has bee. Awful for several years now"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.espn.score_center","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espn.score_center&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Talking Tom Cat 2","description":"The legend is back!

It is much more than your average city simulator or one of the tycoon games. It takes the best of two worlds in just the right proportions: the sense of adventure from airplane games, and the need to plan strategically from the city simulators. If you’re starting to think that there are things beyond farming, put your farm sim on hold and start building your town that will gradually become a city, and then a megapolis with the best airport in the world! We know how plane games can become repetitive over time, so we are constantly improving this city simulator, to ensure that our players are always engaged, both on the ground and in the air.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to try out the role of an air tycoon or an airline commander, you’ll find something to love about Airport City. \r\n\r\nBuild a modern international-class terminal to send an airplane to whichever corner of the world you want. Just get your aircraft in the air and land them in any destination, from a faraway town to a shining megapolis.

It is much more than your average city simulator or one of the tycoon games. It takes the best of two worlds in just the right proportions: the sense of adventure from airplane games, and the need to plan strategically from the city simulators. If you’re starting to think that there are things beyond farming, put your farm sim on hold and start building your town that will gradually become a city, and then a megapolis with the best airport in the world! We know how plane games can become repetitive over time, so we are constantly improving this city simulator, to ensure that our players are always engaged, both on the ground and in the air.<br><br>Whether you want to try out the role of an air tycoon or an airline commander, you’ll find something to love about Airport City. <br><br>Build a modern international-class terminal to send an airplane to whichever corner of the world you want. Just get your aircraft in the air and land them in any destination, from a faraway town to a shining megapolis. To make your travels memorable, you can bring back rare artifacts and unique collections.

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly.

Dear haters of Moy, This game is fun just try it all out Turn off your Wi fi so ads can't get in the way. If you think it's not educational, it's really educational. You can learn to pet games like Pou, or all of the virtual games.... It's ok if my review is not helpful... The important thing is.. You can't pet Moy, you can't pet any virtual games... I know what you're thinking \"Any virtual games are not educational...\" But that's what you only think","Nice game, especially when it's only the 4th version! Although i get bombarded with ads of the new game, you can try it! But it'll take more space. The evolution game is especially fun when you're an evolution games pro player.","Moy 4 is a really nice game and I love playing the mini games. But I am on level thirty three right now and every time I leave the game when I go back I realise that I have been taken back in the level.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth!

Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building.

The different game modes are awesome, and the reward system is generous. The Hero/Villain Roster is amazing! I was playing SW:GOH, for years and the developers ended up ruining the game over the years. They focused more on making money rather than keeping it fun. The rewards became very slim. But, if this games stays the way it is with great reward drops, and fairly priced in-game purchases, I'll play this game everyday, and I'll gladly recommend it to everyone I can.","Amazing game. Is not a money grab like the avengers game. It be cool if they can bring some new cools updates. Such as Allowing to invite random people to an alliance. Able to join a random alliance. Heroic mode cost a lot of energy so there a limit of how much you can play. Overall is an amazing game. But the game might need more funding and cool features to get more players Still derseve 5 starts","Been playing for 4 years or more daily (absolutely love it). Best mobile game to date. Very in depth rpg system. Every battle can be different with tons of different play styles. We'll over a 100 characters maybe even nearing 200 now. You can play this game daily for 10 minutes or a few hours to get daily challenges it's all up to you. Or you can play in few minute increments if your a busy worker. Not pay to win, paying only helps you boost a little faster but not necessary. Favorite game!","Great game, especially for beginners, but the grind is made too long and most characters become useful only after certain Legendary Skills have been unlocked, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money very early on you won't have these abilities that make most characters good, also energy goes way too fast, and instead of having a node be playable without recharging it 3 times make it 5, a too hardcore grind right off the bat will make some players quit the game","I've been playing faithfully for three years, got all the characters, was really strong, then they go and add one character (Black Flash) that makes it where you can't do anything and die every single time. It was great until they added that character. TONE DOWN BLACK FLASH SO WE CAN DO PLAY INSTEAD OF ALL CHARACTERS BEING DEFEATED BEFORE WE CAN EVEN DO ONE ATTACK!!!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.wb.goog.dc.legends","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.dc.legends&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Pepi House: Happy Family","description":"Meet and greet the huge Pepi family in PEPI HOUSE!

Tidy up rooms in a fun way, create new house rules in the virtual world first and then apply them to your daily life. Talk about activities, broaden your vocabulary, experiment and most importantly have some fun and healthy laughter!\r\n\r\nExplore the digital doll house by simply checking the environment and interacting with it – fix your family car, do the laundry, dress-up characters, or make them a tasty burger! Want even more? Go ahead, use our elevator to move items between the floors, discover new combos (combinations), or even prank some of the house dwellers to see their reactions! PEPI HOUSE is all about the freedom of making your own choices and learning what you can do with various different items or their combinations.\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES:\r\n• 4 house floors representing different areas of a household.\r\n• 10 different characters (Including favorite pets!).\r\n• Hundreds of items available for play.\r\n• Themed rooms carefully represent the real-life environment.

It's pretty fun! There's several rooms, enough to keep me busy and entertained. And the characters are also very silly and creative which I like.. like there's robots, astronauts, bubble guys and fish too. The best thing about it was all the stuff there was to grab and click on... And it truly represented a real hospital with all the different areas including the waiting rooms and parking lot where the ambulance pulls in. 👍","my cousin can't play every time my cousin go's in the app. she watches a ad to unlock the rest of the floors but it freezes. and never lets her in the app there's no x button to go back into the game. then she resets the app same thing happened. please fix this for my cousin she plays on tablet by the way. she keeps on bothering me so fix this glitch. Edit: yes I can see the ad I deleted the app then installed it still same thing it's stuck the number the timer that tells you when the ad is over","I would give this game 5 star rating but it isn't PERFECT, its fun and inspires you and this goes for every game of Pepi I m disappointed because I can't have ALL of the levels of the building. You can watch a video but that only gives you 15 minutes to play with every thing. Please fix this and make all levels playable without ha b ing to play","It's fun to know but you have to watch and add every time a timer runs out and it doesn't even give you that much time I would rather just not download the game at all because there's barely any rooms that are free you have to watch ads to get them and the ads are so long I rather you just pay for the entire game then have to watch it at every time you want to play it","This game is amazing! I can take care of patients and heal them if they have broken bones! I can also take care of babies in nursery, and so much more! I love this so much, This is the BEST hospital game ever! And because I wanna grow up to be a doctor, this inspires me even more! I highly recommend this. I can watch an ad to unlock everything for 15 minutes! It's worth it, and I'm very happy with this game! It is so much fun and it's also really educational for kids. I give this a 10/10!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.PepiPlay.PepiHospital","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PepiPlay.PepiHospital&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Mobile Strike","description":"Become an action hero like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the new game of modern war -  Mobile Strike!

What a waste of time it was you need different speed ups for different things like troops for example there is no generic speed up for all troop types but multiple types of speed ups you can only use for certain class plus for me to progress from where I left I have to spend a tonne of money I cant upgrade or do research unless I buy packs this is not a free to play game. It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!! And for the RICHIE RICH PEOPLE out there that loves to spend $$$$$ then go play Mobile Strike Gaming and you'll feel right at Home then tooo!!!!
