Now, since \"upgrade\". it's pretty inefficient and will no longer use it nor recommend it. You have to wonder what the heck are developers doing when they \"upgrade\" things. They are obviously not users. Now, you can't enter international cities (I have family in Europe) and you can't enter temp widget on the status bar of your phone, And the worst thing is the new mapping..... a regressive, backwards attempt. Horrible app, horrible \"upgrade\". Would give less stars if I could. Will be uninstalling.","I don't like the new layout. Used to have up to date weather banner on app screen. It's gone since update and can't find out how to get it back! This new version is no longer useful to me. May uninstall it.","Do not care for the new version/layout at all.

Need to separate out different types of alerts so I can choose what I want to be notified. As it is now its the app that cried wolf, and if there was a serious weather or news alert it probably goes unnoticed because its buried in other alerts or in my case you get frustrated with junk push alerts and just turn off notifications. Even the Wichita ABC station app has customizable alerts.","Great wonderful app to have anywhere at anytime ,Thank You","Bugs to pick out permanently so that inset settings are more personalized toward the weather. This is critically important, rebuttal is not, the southerly broadcast sector is presently/currently vulnerable, and the snags are bugs, the app keeps stopping. An update is required, to the app itself, although if it is not available at any time however, an uninstall must come soon for me as an app user.","We moved 5 years ago from NW OKC to the NE part of Lake Murray.

Now, the 10-day forecast, current temp, everything is disabled, so I uninstalled it, reinstalled it, and now wish I hadn't bothered. This app is now just useless. I agree with the first poster. I don't know why you guys don't listen to the users, but I guess 4 stars is enuf for you. Terrible app now. 7/15/21: Your update didn't work. Still crashing. Totally useless. 0 stars.","Your stand alone weather app was far and beyond better than this. Having to navigateto the weather section is ridiculous. If I wanted to look at the news, I'd download your news app. I can't stand when companies try to improve upon something that already works. Then in the process, completely screwing things up. IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT! Stop trying to change things, just to change them. The weather app alone worked so much better and had better features that this new version lacks.

It worked perfectly, and then it suddenly didn't give me anything other than the radar. I hate this new app. I just wanted the weather not all the news and other bullsh**. I cant even get a live radar for my area anymore. You have more complaints now than ever before. No one likes this app for weather. You should have kept the news and weather separate. Now I have to find a new weather app along with the many others that are leaving you because of this. .","If you want to see weather quickly this app is NOT for you!!
