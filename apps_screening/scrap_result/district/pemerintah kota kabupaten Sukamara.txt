It's really a great game. Rephrase that. If money wasn't the top priority this app would be so awesome for all consumers to enjoy. If u don't have 100 bucks a week to spend at the least. Don't play ffxv.","You can play free to play but its made so that some items are only available for a limited time or never and if you miss them you have to wait until they are offered as a prize months later. The p2p players can gift others a catch up token which often includes things past the paywall which is nice. Its a war game much much more than a city building one. Tries to get you to spend $. And different pack offers based on spending tier.","This game is legitimate garbage. All it does is drag the final fantasy name through the mud. You try and play and just get one tapped by someone 2 levels above you since they love balancing to make players spend money. If you don't spend or know people who will help you by spending than you're not gonna go anywhere. The support, sorry \"support\" actually told me when I have issues its my fault. I asked about the scaling of their events. They said its only for high levels spend money. GG Greed","I give it 5 stars cause it has helped me thru very tough times. Being able to talk communicate and strategize with other players. Never experienced anything like it. I was able to stay out of trouble and to better my life at same time. We all experience difficulties on buying packs. But truthfully I'm seeing people that has not spent money are hardly any catch up to the rest of us that do spend regularly.This is why buying the empire boosts are a must.This is what makes you better. GOD bless","0/10 Would not recommend. Pros: If you don't value your time and money, Congratulations you are the target audience for this game. Cons: 1) A window pops-up every 10 seconds telling you to spend money and you can't tell it to go away for the day like some other games with a similar pop-up. 2) The game doesn't really have anything to do with FF. They just took a poorly made game and through-in some pngs of ffXV characters.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth! Had huge glitch on my game play, took a couple of weeks to fix, they got it done!!! Thank you all. Awesome job well done. Totally locked in forever. 👍👍 Once again the Tech Team has stepped up to Excellence. Thanks 😊 7.21.21","Fantastic idea ! 2 stars missing because this game does not load properly. Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building. It also have military, airport, railway, minerals, space oruented,....etc 3.In each and every places has unique song i really have enjoyed it. 4.

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!!

Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More).

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match.

You buy the packs and so much of what you buy you never get. Fun game, but \"free play\" sadly isn't much fun as you can't compete and always lose everything when you can't afford shields.","This is a pay to win game. No matter how many free events there are you never going to get what is offered to people who pay. There are people with all over a billion power they will farm you. If you can't be on the game daily even free events aren't going to help. Plan to play for 3 years before you can compete and by then they will be even stronger. Maybe if you had just start up battlefields.","Tell you what, I watched the gameplay of this and I was sold! It looks like toystory meets call of duty!! I downloaded it instantly, looks great!!! Ill give It 5 stars until further notice. Remember, Xbox and Playstation controllers can connect to your android device, so you don't need the touch screen to play! Anymore :D","Well, I saw this game on an ad and I though \"Hey this looks interesting\" but when I actually installed it, it was NOTHING like the ad, it was one of those territory games, but the thing in the ad said that it was a Third Person shooter game like COD or Fortnite, but no it wasn't, talk about a rip-off. Anyways, it was a complete waste of time.","The game takes some time getting used to, however 9/10 times you're going to get attacked by someone three times stronger than you (most likely pays to win), so understanding how to get aegis and leveling up is paramount.

Is not a money grab like the avengers game. It be cool if they can bring some new cools updates. Such as Allowing to invite random people to an alliance. Able to join a random alliance. Heroic mode cost a lot of energy so there a limit of how much you can play. Overall is an amazing game. But the game might need more funding and cool features to get more players Still derseve 5 starts","Been playing for 4 years or more daily (absolutely love it). Best mobile game to date. Very in depth rpg system. Every battle can be different with tons of different play styles. We'll over a 100 characters maybe even nearing 200 now. You can play this game daily for 10 minutes or a few hours to get daily challenges it's all up to you. Or you can play in few minute increments if your a busy worker. Not pay to win, paying only helps you boost a little faster but not necessary. Favorite game!","I've been playing faithfully for three years, got all the characters, was really strong, then they go and add one character (Black Flash) that makes it where you can't do anything and die every single time. It was great until they added that character. TONE DOWN BLACK FLASH SO WE CAN DO PLAY INSTEAD OF ALL CHARACTERS BEING DEFEATED BEFORE WE CAN EVEN DO ONE ATTACK!!!","Great game, especially for beginners, but the grind is made too long and most characters become useful only after certain Legendary Skills have been unlocked, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money very early on you won't have these abilities that make most characters good, also energy goes way too fast, and instead of having a node be playable without recharging it 3 times make it 5, a too hardcore grind right off the bat will make some players quit the game","Best Comic book mobile game, period. Marvel's and even Star Wars' attempt at copying this game's success and it's formula fail miserably and don't come close to the fun had with DC and all their amazing characters. It's far from perfect when considering all the micro transactions and some new heroes being harder to unlock than others and upgrading them to legendary status etc. The grind's too long but that's unfortunately standard in mobile games.

For technical help, please email appstore@tunein.com.","comments":["Pretty good app overall, but one major negative is that it loses connection a lot and every time I hit pause, even if it's just for a few seconds, the app makes me listen to a 30 second ad! Very, very very annoying when I'm listening to a live sports game! Please stop being so greedy and fix this issue! Put like a 5 minute grace period in or something reasonable.","Enjoy this application for many years now. However, recently I am having issues with the sleep timer on my favorite radio station. Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","It's a good app, you can access 1000s of stations but one of the joys that made it similar to listening to a real live radio was the sleep timer feature.

Mario Kart Tour doesn't feature invasive ads. sorry, this fancy version of Temple Run doesn't get to ruin my fun with non-removable ads. the nostalgia isn't worth a poor mobile game experience","It a really cool game, I used to play it all the time when it first came out and I just came back to it recently. I like it but there are a few bugs that need fixing. Mostly the event bug. After a few runs it doesn't save anymore progress, it'll just stay at a certain number, but it will use up your tickets. It's frustrating when it uses up all your tickets and your \"mines destroyed\" number is still the same number as before you used the ticket(s). Please fix the event bug, thank you.","Do you remember the first game? If you do you can see the bunch of problems from the new one if you don't I'm very shocked anyway now getting to the point of it first of all the animation aren't really smooth second of all to me it's really glitchy second of all why are they all Naruto running??????? That when I was like an answer the fact of the animations are not smooth and it's glitchy basically just ruined the whole entire game for me iI'm sorry but you have to fix this immediately","I gave this game one star because of multiple reasons and I don't think I was the only one that had these issues with this game. The game controls are very bad. Even worse than the first game's controls. Sometimes I tried to go to the left and the game would send me all the way to the right. This happened way more times than I can keep track of. This game is very unfinished and the developers almost never worked on it after it was released. I saw the game, tried it and it was worse than 06. Fix","I played this game in an IPhone 7 for years and it didn't give me issues. I had everyone maxed out. Now I changed to an android and now runs really bad. This game laggs so hard that the game freezes and crashes all together. When an event appears, I use all the tickets and loose all of my progress on that run. I've tried three times and it gives me the same results. This update is garbage! Don't play this!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sega.sonicboomandroid","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sega.sonicboomandroid&hl=en&gl=us"}]
