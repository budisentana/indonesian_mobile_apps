Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids\r\n\r\nA safer online experience for kids\r\nWe work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\r\n\r\nCustomize your child’s experience with Parental Controls\r\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\r\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.\r\nBlocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.\r\nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\r\n\r\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\r\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”. \r\n\r\nSelect the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of videos for all kinds of kids\r\nOur library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between.\r\n\r\nOther important information:\r\nParental setup is needed to ensure the best experience possible for your kid.\r\nYouTube Kids contains paid ads in order to offer the app for free.

Exactly I would never show the content that it push, but no way to find the searched content. As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players.

It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle.

Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Zenly - Your map, your people","description":"Zenly is a map that lets you know what your friends and family are up to.

Plus half the things you say in the ad doesn't make sense. Any way you advertise this app is just gonna make it look creepy and kinda stalkerish.

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate.

But I wish there was a way of removing listings from suggestions. If I view a home and decide it's not for me, I should have a way to stop seeing it appear on my suggestions. F/I a beautiful 4bd2bth at 90k but it's in a high crime or flood zone. I can favorite, but I can't refuse to see it.","Seems to be getting worse instead of better. I like that I can go to the listing and it's accurate. I wish every listing would be consistent in showing the rental Zestimate at the top or show unavailable if it isn't. The information is usually accurate and I like that there is a link to the county website for the property I'm looking at. The worst thing recently is that I can't update my property info without a real estate agent. Also miss the option to see public view on claimed homes.","Really like the zillow app, would be nice if the app alerted me when someone makes an offer on a property I saved. Would like to get into bidding wars on properties I want to buy. Missed many properties I would have paid more for. Would like to see properties sold on an ebay type format once qualified. Agents are not good about answering questions or making contact through zillow.","Doesn't work anymore. I get an email notification of a new house on the market, but when I click the link the app doesn't open that house. Instead it opens a list of hypothetically related houses. It honestly looks like an embedded web page, and behaves like one. It doesn't scroll properly buttons don't work.

However, i have given it 4 stars because of a glitch that i do not know how to fix. I have made two custom characters, but I can only get one to appear at a time. one will appear, but when i edit the other one so it appears as well the first one vanishes, and can't be found under the stop sign menu. in addition, there are a lot, and i mean a lot of in app purchases, and there is almost nothing for free to play users.","Toca world is an Amazing game! It is full of imagination and creativity. It is a good game for children about the age 6-11. I have played Toca games for about 5 years now and I'm still not bored of it. For a start, when I first played Toca games I loved them! And so when Toca World came out I wanted to play it so bad because all the games were mixed together. For the positives, It doesn't have many ads at all. For the Negatives, you have to pay to expand your world which isn't much of a problem.","I love this app! And the new stuff! But this review Is not mine but is gonna be for my friend. She made a schoolhouse last night or something, Next day (which is today) everything disappeared... Some stuff are not available to get anymore :(. Like she lost the backpack from the gift which is not available anymore (I think?) I really wanna help her out but I dont know how. Soooooo the only way to fix this was telling it in a review! I dont know how you can help but... This was worth it ^_^","There are few complaints I need to make sure get patched. 1, I make 2 characters in the creator. As soon as I go to the floogle place, it only gives me only one character. 2. I put things on the walls, few seconds later it disappears also with other things it happens. Also, it won't let me open boxes. It's annoying because it's with my friend aswell.","I love this app and others do love it to but the only problem is, (why its only 4 stars) is it takes so long to load in the game for me, I have a samsung galaxy if that helps please make it load faster if you can and maybe add more houses? I think everyone would go bonkers if you added new houses and items and new hair styles and clothes, so sorry for only 4 stars but the loading could be better, but I look foreward to playing this game everyday!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tocaboca.tocalifeworld","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tocaboca.tocalifeworld&hl=en&gl=us"}]
