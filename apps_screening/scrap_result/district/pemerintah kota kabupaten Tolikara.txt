But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn‚Äôt start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Waplog - Dating App to Chat & Meet New People","description":"Waplog Dating App\r\n\r\nThe fastest-growing dating app with more than 90 million users worldwide.

As premium YouTube user it would be an additional option I can save the content at there, but some strange rules kid content can't be saved, not even music. Unuseful even harmful app this kid version","It's good for my kids but I have the same problem with it that I do with adult YouTube. I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a üîê screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included .

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little. But they slowed the car like WAY too much."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rkgames.smashywanted","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rkgames.smashywanted&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Block City Wars: Pixel Shooter with Battle Royale","description":"5..4..3..2..1..

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

If you don't have coins, your options are extremely limited. For example, much of the gacha are coin-based and only some feature diamonds, meaning you get bottom of the barrel items most of the time (if any). On top of that the diamond currency is also hard to acquire. Want to try to get items in events? Sorry! Those aren't very f2p friendly either, disappointed.","here are some things I'd like to see in the game: 1. being able to get the materials you want while trading with neighbors: it'd make crafting a lot more easier 2. the recording button 3. a way of leveling up the VIP status apart from the in-app purchases 4. the daily gems earned watching ads 5. the option to change your LinePLAY birthday to your real one 6.","This game is really the best game I played.

I'll be waiting for an answer from the developer and make it fast.","for an expensive game, your staff sure have little care for fixing simple bugs. or is it intentional that you refrain players from watching ads, so they will purchase overpriced game currency? we pay with our time for viewing them, have some decency. frankly, all you have left is good item designs. even the new boss raid requires money to get the nicer prizes. when I said listen to your players for once, I didn't mean to give them more things to SPEND REAL MONEY ON."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"jp.naver.lineplay.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.naver.lineplay.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Opera News: Breaking Local & US Headlines","description":"We‚Äôre proud to be enjoyed and trusted by over 350 million global users.

The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Airport City - transport manager","description":"Airport games are a true adventure, and Airport City is among the best!

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that.

Suscription is axed, this works worse than Google Play Music with an horrible UI. Furthermore it does not integrate into any streaming service and equipment for music outside those few chromecast ones. Quality in sound is well behind other services as well... Is sad to say that the mismanegement of products in Google as of now makes me very suspicious to drop my money on anything google from now on. Sad.","After so many years, can we have some basic playlist editing features like SELECTING MULTIPLE SONGS or SORTING?!?!?!??!!?!?!?!?! These features are so basic that users started asking for them since the start of this sorry excuse you call a product. And great job ignoring us for years. I hope you are proud of yourselves: you took away a perfectly adequate product that is Google Play Music and incompetently gave us this pathetic \"fancy\" replacement with a stupid AI suggesting horrible songs and no adequate functionality to build our own playlists. You should thank the oligopoly that I still allow your undeserving staff to make money off of me. I'm paying mostly to get rid of youtube ads.","Seldom works as promised. If you want to stream random songs this might be fine, but it DOES NOT WORK to play your own music as requested. Completely fails to shuffle playlists: plays the same songs, in the same order, over and over, every time. WARNING - if you use this service to upload your own music files you can NOT get them back, except as unlabeled zip files without folders; they gave me mine as 44 different 2gig files I had to download individually. Crazy! Display of titles is shockingly awful: it often can't fit the whole song title or band name, across various platforms. The inability to select more than one track at a time is absurd and makes manipulating Playlists extremely cumbersome. Works half as well as Pandora but insists on reverting to its own recommendations rather than the requested songs. Functionality with Android Auto is spotty as best: in the car I can't NOT shuffle a playlist, on the TV via AndoirdTV I can only play a playlist in exact order, and using voice commands to my speaker it can't shuffle. Paying for Google1 access to try and fix the bugs was completely pointless, an offensive waste of time and money (\"Have you tried resetting and reinstalling it?\" LOL great support). They kept promising it was going to get better and it just keeps working worse... I've been a Premium member and was a Google Music Play user since day one (and happily would have paid that fee forever!), but now I'm quitting because I'm paying them a monthly fee in order to NOT stream my own music. This has been a horrendous nightmare inflicted on me by those I trusted most with my precious music library, and I don't plan on letting them forget about their failure any time soon. The fact that so many users have been requesting the addition of a Sleep Time for so long-- and it goes ignored-- shows me they just don't care. Most frustrating of all, every single problem I've mentioned was non-existent on the Google Play Music planform before this awful \"upgrade.\" Music lovers should steer far clear of this app if you hope to control your own listening experience.","Just a redirect to YouTube itself, prioritises videos over music. Can't find a browse by album. You're better off using the YouTubeMusic app on your phone and casting to your TV than using this app. At least that way you can browse or find albums/songs/artists you want and control their playback. O, and no background playback, so unlike every other music player app on Android TV (Spotify, Pandora, etc), you can't exit this app and let it run in the background while, say, having your screen saver run. How can Google's own music app on its own platform be worse than third party apps? Or even worse than what they have done before with GPM?!

With a new set of songs each Wednesday, there is always more to explore. ","comments":["This is the first (and only) music app I have ever used. And my GOD what a choice of songs. YouTube Music must have every song üéµ in the world!! And eventually if you hit the like button often enough they will create a list of just your favorite songs/videos. I pay for YouTube premium and I'm sure that's why I don't get any ads at all. I'm very üòä happy with YouTube Music so far.","This app is alright. I have premium, so I can't comment of the ads. The functions for listening to songs are quite good. However, ocationaly on songs it will say they are from a different artist, or play a song to what it says and what the album cover is. For example, when I went into thefatrat's \"Rise up\" it played a song called solitude instead. This was later fixed, however, if I go to the song, \"Kings and Queens Part two\" by Ava Max, it will sometimes play the wrong song.","The radio option is the only thing I really don't like about it. When you selected \"radio\" on an artist in Google play music it played songs that were from similar artists. YTM however, seems to play songs from artists that you've listened to a lot. Example: Hit the radio button on a power metal artist and the radio starts playing a bunch of TOOL because I've listened to them a lot and it really doesn't fit at all, especially when I'm using it to explore other artists in the power metal genre.","Not fit for purpose. I've been trying to work with this junk since launch. Spent months creating 12 playlists across 12 genres, totalling 9,170 tracks to listen to my playlists across my 7 Google hub max speakers. However, regardless of what playlist you select, even on shuffle, it will always start off playing the first track. It will then continue to play the same 20 or 30 tracks over and over again all day long even when playlist has over 1000 tracks. Switched to Spotify yesterday, heaven!!","I enjoy using the app. It creates several Mixes for you from different genres & eras that you listen to so you can choose what you're in the mood for. Every Wednesday there's a Discover Mix which I love. It's a mix of music they think you'll like based on your music choices. I'd give it 5 stars, but they took away the tab that used to drop down with your task bar. That was great bc you could skip through songs without leaving the app you're currently in.

I don't mind watching add because I want certain reward but having to watch them just to play the game is WAY too much","It's a fun game but honestly, way too many ads and it has a versus mode for pvp but will not connect to Facebook so I can't experience the entirety of the game. Not connecting to Facebook, minus 1 star, so many ads, minus 1 star. Fix those 2 issues and it'll be a 5 star game","A great game but when i play online the play becomes unpredictable. ie gears dont change on time throtel not responsive nos dont work. Im going to try t.s 2 . 4stars from me is about the best rating ever.thankyou.a great game","I luv this game I used to play it when I was younger everything has changed just wish tht if I missed just one day u didn't have to go back to the first criminal bust and start all over but other then tht this game is easy I'm flying throught it just fix the busting criminals part so we don't have to restart from the first one just because we missed a day","Could be a 5 star game, but every time your playing and winning, the system takes over and would not allow you to shift the gears on your car."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.tbegames.and.top_speed_racing","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tbegames.and.top_speed_racing&hl=en&gl=us"}]
