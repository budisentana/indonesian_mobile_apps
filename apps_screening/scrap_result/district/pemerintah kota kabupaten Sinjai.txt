Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

The arrival/ departure times for CTA trains could be a bit clearer. Think Ventra app. Has a comprehensive selection of bus and rail routes but the time displays are difficult to understand. Having a list of departure / arrival times would help tremendously. All in all a good transit reference app and I like it. I'll give it more stars when I get used to it.","This is a good app, but resent update that brought ads just horrible. Ads that jump at me right when I press the button to start a bus ride, when I need to scan a QR code on the bus station and get in the bus I get a full screen pop up. Your decision just forced me to move to other app. Good luck with this. I was loyal user but for now I am out.","The app can be very helpful, but arrival times can be a bit off which can be annoying if you don't plan around it. Another big problem I have with the app is that it's downright unusable when in dark mode. Many elements of the UI don't properly transition to a brighter color when in dark mode and are unreadable, and switching back to light mode is annoying. All and all I would say the app is a4/5 on light mode and a 1/5 on dark mode","I've enjoyed this app for years over my local government's attempt at an app, but the advertisements have become a problem. When it's crunch time and you need to check on buses with a sense of urgency, having a full page ad (usually of another map app?? WHY??) that has to load, then be exited, has actually screwed me several times.","So confusing to look at all I want to do is search for and find out a bus time, it's just far too fussy,. Update Developer response saying this is in the lines tab. How would I be expected to know that? . I am looking for a bus time / route. I know nothing about bus lines and which services they operate. A simple search box with destination and from would suffice, just as when I book a train."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tranzmate","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tranzmate&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Airport City - transport manager","description":"Airport games are a true adventure, and Airport City is among the best!

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles. Will update my feedback as I continue using it"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.mapswithme.maps.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"TuneIn Radio: News, Sports & Online Music Stations","description":"FROM NOW ON, THIS IS RADIO.\r\n\r\nTuneIn brings together live news, sports, music, podcasts and radio stations from around the world.\r\n\r\nWith live and on-demand audio from the voices you trust, on any device, you're never without something amazing to listen to.\r\n\r\nALL YOUR AUDIO IN ONE APP.\r\n\r\n• News: Listen to and stay informed with live 24/7 news from local, national and global news sources, including CNBC, CNN, MSNBC, FOX News Radio, NPR and BBC.\r\n\r\n• Sports:  Listen to live NFL, NHL, and college games, anywhere you go, plus local, national, and global sports talk stations.

Very, very very annoying when I'm listening to a live sports game! Please stop being so greedy and fix this issue! Put like a 5 minute grace period in or something reasonable.","Enjoy this application for many years now. However, recently I am having issues with the sleep timer on my favorite radio station. Set for a time to shut off, shows the alarm in the corner but does not shut off. The only way I can get it to work is by restarting my phone. Please fix! Love TuneIn!","The latest update did not solve the problem of listening to the app while using other apps. I used to be able to scroll through my email or check news etc. The app cuts out if I use other apps. I couldn't change my rating to 1 star. My last review came 6 months ago. Things are getting worse instead of better. Again, very disappointed. Update: Changed the setting as suggested. App is now performing to my liking. Thanks to a quick response to solve my issue.","It's a good app, you can access 1000s of stations but one of the joys that made it similar to listening to a real live radio was the sleep timer feature. It's not working on the current version for some reason which is a shame and a pain. Not an issue if listening during the day, I would imagine though.","App often goes into endless cycle of ads and doesn't return to radio station I'm listening to. I understand having ads when I'm not paying for subscription but I just listened to 20 minutes of ads and had to turn off because it won't return to radio station I was listening to. Have to close, reopen, listen to more ads then back to station. And then when radio station returns from its own commercial break TuneIn will suddenly cut to its own ads & begins endless cycle of ads w/o return to station."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"tunein.player","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Baby Panda Home Safety","description":"Home is a special place.

It has minor issues of real time. Street view doesn't always work, even after I previously did a street view of that location. This app would be perfect if I could program my own route. I'm an escort (Pilot car) for oversize loads. We have routes issued to us by the states and counties. Plus, sometimes I don't like the route, google maps offers. One last thing, I wish we could switch to satellite view AFTER we hit \"start\". Thank you!","For quite a while I couldn't get voiced notifications. So, I decided to \"Google\" it. It said, delete cache and data. It seemed to work fine. I have just done an 8.5 hour journey that should have taken 5.5 hours. No fault of Google obviously. However, 3/4 of the way through the trip, the notifications stopped. Then 30 minutes before our journey end the voiced notifications packed up. If this does not alter I'll try 'Waze', it looks a much better option.","Never uses the most direct or fastest route. I entered my destination and it said it would take 1 hour and 40 minutes on the fastest of the 3 options of routes it gave me, which I knew was way off. I used another navigation app and reached my destination in 50 minutes. Other times it has taken me off the beaten path in an unfamiliar city and through some very bad neighborhoods when I could have stayed on the interstate and reached my destination much, much faster and safer. Do not recommend.","This application is always inaccurate with time tracking. It also makes serious errors which make the driver lost. It also makes it hard to see future directions. When it does a good job it is excellent but when it doesn't it is highly frustrating. The app made a mistake and said Jefferson hwy was Jefferson heights and kept sending me to the wrong location. It also gets lost in the French quarter. It is frustrating and can cause loss of employment and lost time in one's life.","Maps has not been working properly for me for the past month! It won't load the map and when getting directions, it wants me to take the longest, most ridiculous route to get to my destination. It also loses signal often and gets lost, or will tell me to turn at the very last minute causing me to miss turns.

Just the directions alone with voice navigation , and more detail like traffic or construction , etc Which is a constant here in Houston. I love that it is lighter than Google Maps and does not need a speedy WiFi connection and it doesn't eat up your memory. You can also get phone numbers and more pertinent information much quicker and easier in this app. My favorite part is the discovery of new places.","My Pixel 3a is starting to show its age unfortunately, and with that the main app makes my phone extremely laggy and causes other background apps to freeze or crash. Go on my phone acts as if the app isn't even running! Also something that is worth mentioning that will make me a perma user of this app, even on a brand new phone, is the fact that navigation and the map are two separate app instances. You can navigate the map and keep navigation open individually. No more accidental closures!!","One of the best apps especially for my Nexus 5 , low memory... However, I have notice a couple months ago after the recent update (from v144 to 152) the green android icon appeared on Drawer also home screen and not the ORIGINAL Google Maps Go icon even though I clear cache or reset the phone...can you fix this please?

Then it didn't work again so I tried downloading it again. But every time I sign up, it keeps saying that I have been banned from using the app I don't understand and don't even know what I did wrong..

That is not enough time, and to automatically start charging your Google Play account, I thought this app had a free version. I can't get to the free version. What ever happened to \"try before you buy? Edit: OK, it is possible to kill both\" free trial offer\" screens and try the app, just a lot of ads. I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate. A free trial means you don't need to do anything to use it, including making an effort to subscribe. UPD: sorry, my bad. Didn't notice the X button. The app is great, considering paid subscription."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.apalon.weatherradar.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apalon.weatherradar.free&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"My Town : Police Station.

Also this is NOT a ripoff in my opinion. Did yall not know runner games existed before cookie run? And they weren't the first to make a runner game?? :/ I like this one more since you dont have tickets/energy, and you can play unendlessly! :)","I really love this game because it is so addictive. I can unlock new stores, cool characters, and more! I can also get new pets to help you in running! I'll definitely recommend it!","I love this game because I can collect some diamonds and candies, get some new characters and new candy stores and I can open some different chests. I love all of the Talking Tom games.","I love that everyone has their own way to destroy obstacles and when you unlock more that one characters you'll be able to run with two but it should have been all of them","So, I looked at all the reviews before installing this as usual. To me most of the reviews were negative and I thought that the game wouldn't be so good but something from the pictures and adds made me want to try it. I installed it and I DO NOT regret installing. This game is the best and not so many adds either. Through all my experience, I haven't had many adds and I've played it quite a lot. It is very fun so it gets rid of your boredom. Install this now!!! The characters are cute aswell."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.outfit7.talkingtomcandyrun","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outfit7.talkingtomcandyrun&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Pepi Hospital: Learn & Care","description":"Step into a PEPI HOSPITAL and become doctor, patient or just a curious explorer!

It's pretty fun! There's several rooms, enough to keep me busy and entertained. And the characters are also very silly and creative which I like.. like there's robots, astronauts, bubble guys and fish too. The best thing about it was all the stuff there was to grab and click on... And it truly represented a real hospital with all the different areas including the waiting rooms and parking lot where the ambulance pulls in. 👍","my cousin can't play every time my cousin go's in the app. she watches a ad to unlock the rest of the floors but it freezes. and never lets her in the app there's no x button to go back into the game. then she resets the app same thing happened. please fix this for my cousin she plays on tablet by the way. she keeps on bothering me so fix this glitch. Edit: yes I can see the ad I deleted the app then installed it still same thing it's stuck the number the timer that tells you when the ad is over","I would give this game 5 star rating but it isn't PERFECT, its fun and inspires you and this goes for every game of Pepi I m disappointed because I can't have ALL of the levels of the building. You can watch a video but that only gives you 15 minutes to play with every thing. Please fix this and make all levels playable without ha b ing to play","It's fun to know but you have to watch and add every time a timer runs out and it doesn't even give you that much time I would rather just not download the game at all because there's barely any rooms that are free you have to watch ads to get them and the ads are so long I rather you just pay for the entire game then have to watch it at every time you want to play it","This game is amazing! I can take care of patients and heal them if they have broken bones! I can also take care of babies in nursery, and so much more! I love this so much, This is the BEST hospital game ever! And because I wanna grow up to be a doctor, this inspires me even more! I highly recommend this. I can watch an ad to unlock everything for 15 minutes!

I enjoy using it for writing, and local saving of documents is helpful. However, it can be a little janky with loading large files, and the italics button (which I use quite often for my creative writing) on Android is now squirreled away in a hard-to-find, unhelpful location, and was replaced with the checklist button. If not for that small gripe, I'd give five stars.","I gave it five stars, because it has made things easier with my disability. However, voice to text seems to fail me often, which isn't exactly the apps issue. I have experienced multiple moments where the app freezes, and won't let me open until connecting to a Wi-Fi network. That is always a bit odd being as my mobile data is available. Not to mention, a bit annoying. There are no ads, but I have it set up this way through my settings.","It's kind of like Google drive was a while ago. It's a great app but it's buggy. As soon as you've got a bit too many files they start to have problems with snycing. As I scroll down they load and glitch out. Sometimes the files don't even show and I have to look for them in the search bar. Now it's worse than it's ever been, files that should be \"available online\" simply don't open. This didn't use to happen..","This would've been five stars last year, but there are two things that are spoiling my experience. First, when my friend and I update our documents, her updates don't fully load for me unless she opens them a second time. Please fix this. Second, the italics button has been moved from the bottom bar to the much less intuitive top button. These extra steps are unnecessary and annoying. Please put it back where it was.","The offline access problem discussed in the most recent reviews started on 30 June after an update to this app. Prior to that I had no problem accessing offline files. I've reported this bug twice but it still has not been fixed in the latest update today. Very disappointed by Google's lack of response to this bug.

This update includes:<br>\t•\tManage your followed podcasts and downloaded episodes directly from Your Library","comments":["Only annoyance is with the podcasts... You can't search within a podcast so you have to scroll until you find the one you want and since they are ordered from new to old, if you let it play automatically, it'll play \"in reverse\" (i.e. Part 2 would play before Part 1.) and every now and then, instead of staying the next episode, it'll go back to the top and play the latest.","When it works nothing beats it but lately it is worst than Sirus.....which is bad. Cuts out every half song...then I wait about 5 minutes and some times it comes back but mostly I need to stop the song and restart it. Very frustrating when trying to get a tan on a beach. The web site on the computer is #1.... but the app for the phone is a big ZERO.","I totally love this app!!! It works good, but there are two problems with it. There are too many ads and also I also had trouble for some time keeping the Bluetooth connection when I open the app and play a radio station or podcast or anything on the app. I know there is nothing wrong with me Bluetooth speaker. My speakers are fully charged and I can play everything else on it. Can you please look into it?","I used to enjoy this app more in the beginning but now not so much. I could add and delete songs and it would only play the songs I added. Now you can't delete any songs and it plays random songs not added by me. Also you can't add any Garth Brooks songs. I even tried the free trial for premium and still no luck. I tried to listen to Garth Brooks radio with unlimited skips and I heard one song from him and skipped over 50 times and nothing. I am currently looking into other music options.","Commercials, Commercials, Commercials! If you like Commercials, then this is the app for you. Every time I use the app, I have to FIRST LISTEN TO FIFTEEN COMMERCIALS before I actually get to the station. I upgraded to the plus service, but to no avail. I'm giving it two stars because after you manage to listen to all of the Commercials, it actually does what it should."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller&hl=en&gl=us"}]
