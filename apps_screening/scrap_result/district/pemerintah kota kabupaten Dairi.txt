There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top.","I thought a Wikipedia app was redundant since the website already exists, but saving articles offline, transferring them between devices, and the clean reading experience with dark mode makes this app and a new account worth it to me. Haven't tried editing with this app yet though. My biggest issue so far is that \"Explore\" should be easier to get to, especially from an open tab. The tabs themselves took some getting used to after coming from iPhone. Small tweaks needed in that area.","It used to be fine, but now in dark or black mode, a lot of text is white on a white background. This usually happens in album track lists or TV show episode lists. Wikipedia kind of uses a white table to display the information, but keeps the text white on top of this table. The only way to see the text is to select the text (as of you are going to copy it) or if the text itself is hyperlink.","UPDATE: layout\\design. App auto-updated itself 2 days ago. (Thanks glitchy PlayStore!) Now app looks 1st gen: bulky & bloated. My previous ver showed (3) \"In the news\" thumbnails; now only 1. PREVIOUSLY; Tech glitch: occasionally, my Favs are cleared w\\o warning (and without clearing app or Samsung Note 5 caches or data). Current open tabs remain, but favorites are deleted.

Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self.

It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"LINE PLAY - Our Avatar World","description":"Be the best you!

I made really good friends and it breaks my heart to leave them behind just because a stupid update won't let me continue playing! It would be much bettet if you didn't have to do so precise information for the account! Please fix this problem! I love this game and I don't want to leave it behind again! By that I mean I've had the game before and the same exact problem happend! Fix this please!","It's a cute app at times, but.. This is the least f2p player friendly app I've come across. If you don't have coins, your options are extremely limited. For example, much of the gacha are coin-based and only some feature diamonds, meaning you get bottom of the barrel items most of the time (if any). On top of that the diamond currency is also hard to acquire. Want to try to get items in events? Sorry! Those aren't very f2p friendly either, disappointed.","here are some things I'd like to see in the game: 1. being able to get the materials you want while trading with neighbors: it'd make crafting a lot more easier 2. the recording button 3. a way of leveling up the VIP status apart from the in-app purchases 4. the daily gems earned watching ads 5. the option to change your LinePLAY birthday to your real one 6.","This game is really the best game I played. But I would give it 5 stars if my account lasted. Everything was working very well when I tried to open it once and it showed me the screen the is shown when you have just downloaded the game. I tried to register my account but it said the my account wasn't even saved in line play. Please fix this I really loved this game and I don't want to uninstall it. I'll be waiting for an answer from the developer and make it fast.","for an expensive game, your staff sure have little care for fixing simple bugs. or is it intentional that you refrain players from watching ads, so they will purchase overpriced game currency? we pay with our time for viewing them, have some decency. frankly, all you have left is good item designs. even the new boss raid requires money to get the nicer prizes. when I said listen to your players for once, I didn't mean to give them more things to SPEND REAL MONEY ON."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"jp.naver.lineplay.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.naver.lineplay.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"NewsBreak: Local News that Connects the Community","description":"News Break believes that local news is different.

When I'm in the middle of reading an article & it refreshes, it goes back to the home page, not where I was when it refreshes. Talk about frustrating & time consuming. Especially when this is happening 3-4 times within a 30-45 minute period. If this keeps up, I'll be looking for another news app!!","Great local news app. I like how the app brings the latest news locally to you via notifications. Alongside having access to local news, you also have access to national news. The only downside in my opinion is when you're lacking a strong cellular or internet connection, you may or may not see a black screen when you click on a news story notification.","While I like all the varied sources of news stories and how that avoids the pitfall of one-sided opinions, the app has a problem. The app often locks up, shuts down and then restarts automatically. This gets annoying, especially when in the middle of reading a story and this happens and you can't find the story again when the app comes back up. Otherwise, it's pretty good.","I give this app 3 stars. Its my favorite news app, but it pisses me off more than any app with its constant shutdowns in the middle of reading. Only happens when i read a story and scroll down to read other stories or links to them at the bottom of the one i finished ....infuriating","Often too many alerts, lots of the alerts aren't local. I'm okay with news updates and things happening across the country, even around the world. However, getting alerts 2 or 3 times a minute, sometimes more, is too much!

The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate.

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it.

You can learn to pet games like Pou, or all of the virtual games.... It's ok if my review is not helpful... The important thing is.. You can't pet Moy, you can't pet any virtual games... I know what you're thinking \"Any virtual games are not educational...\" But that's what you only think","Nice game, especially when it's only the 4th version! Although i get bombarded with ads of the new game, you can try it! But it'll take more space. The evolution game is especially fun when you're an evolution games pro player.","Moy 4 is a really nice game and I love playing the mini games. But I am on level thirty three right now and every time I leave the game when I go back I realise that I have been taken back in the level.

On the 1 hand, I have LOVED this app. Rarely is anything worth the subscription price, yet I continue to splurge on Colorfy. However, it feels like certain strikes against the service have been creeping in that cause me to ask, is this REALLY worth it? Like I am pretty sure in the beginning there weren't super intrusive ads in the paid version (I generally expect a \"premium\" app to be AD-FREE or at least be upfront about it!). I really don't want to unsubscribe, but... Yeah. 😢","I'm very disappointed in the app & will uninstall it after I finish this review. App used to be decent as free, but there now is only a small # of free templates, & no more in my category(mandalas). Even a non-mandala I got free last week & began working on, I now have to sign up for trial of paid version to complete it. There are other apps I can use for free which only require that I watch ads, but Colorfy wants me to pay monthly & I won't do that.","Can't use without signing up for free trial. I don't want a free trial of premium features. I want to try the free and if its worth it upgrade. Stop trying to twist our arms. Hitting cancel and trying to use just takes you back in circles. Uninstall.","Cool app, with lots of great features, colors, and coloring pages, however only about 10% is free. And premium costs $20 a month (very overpriced). It's fun to mess around with for a little while, but I got bored easily because there were only a few pictures/colors I could use, and you can't use any of the pens/brushes.","Honestly this app used to be very nice. What changed? Well a lot, most of the pictures are premium, I wouldn't mind if about 20% of the pictures were premium, but thanks to the greedy maker of colorfy literally 90% the app is premium! Paying isn't a problem, but 20$ a month is just a waist of money. Fix this nonsense please and I'm very sorry if I offended the producer of colorfy."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.fungamesforfree.colorfy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fungamesforfree.colorfy&hl=en&gl=us"}]
