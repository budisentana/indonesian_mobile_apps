A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going. They need to fix that but is something I could live with it. Using Google pixel 5","I've read through your support forums. Can't find answers. Issue started Aug 2nd. All features work except sms.

When connected to android auto I can text people but when I get a reply it shows on car's screen but when I press steering wheel button google assistant says 'there aren't any new messages that I can read.'

I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't have one problem: a terrible Bluetooth connection option. Not sure if it has something to do with the phone I have (Moto G7 power), but every time I try to connect my wireless headphones to the radio, I just hear static. Still, it's great for people who use wired headphones. I also like how it scans local radio stations so that you don't have to skim through stations to get to the one you like.","Works very well speak now it works very well however sometimes be taking a long time to fill up 500 characters especially if you want to give a review that's less than 4 seconds long but if you do not want to review your own products then that is interesting and important I shall notify people who did not want to notify the people thank you for letting me share .","The app work fine but when you quit an app it's notification keeps persistent for a couple of seconds. The app doesn't look very modern, it looks like it's from 2010. The app keep removing the names of radio stations I saved. So please fix it. Moreover this app doesn't support Android 11 media controls.","This app came preinstalled with my phone and is one of the few that I haven't tried to remove. It doesn't require an internet connection and so is the perfect go to entertainment when I have no mobile data. The sound quality is as good as any radio, with the convenience of having it on your mobile device. There are no in app purchases to unlock stations or premium features.

It serves that function fine. However, it's a TERRIBLE app for listening to audiobooks. I often have to re-listen to chapters I've already heard, bookmarks don't work consistently, sometimes the app stops playing on its own, it doesn't acknowledge the \"pause\" function on my headphones, and there's no way to see where you are in a chapter. I wish there was another app I could use with my library card instead of this one.","I think the app is fine with regard to the books available and the audio output. My concern is the timer. I like to set the timer for thirty minutes at bedtime however I am not able to use the 30 selector in this app because it doesn't turn off. That is until you wake up to readers voice and pause it yourself. Earlier times seem to work, but not the 30,45, or 60 minute setting. Strange. I tried uninstall and reinstall but that didn't fix it. So now I can only listen during the day. Can anyone help with this issue?","I like the app but find the selection of books, especially by popular male authors, is limited. The other irritation is the claim available in so many days but it's not available to me and then another waiting period shows up and then another. I have stayed online and checked every 2 minutes but that doesn't help. I suspect there is a waiting list but it would be better if I could see that 8 people were ahead of me and that the days to available shown in the app were meaningless.","I've enjoyed listening to tons of free audiobooks on this app for a few years now. And all you need is your library card if your local library participates. CL will restrict usage especially towards the end of the month but it's workable. Overall, a very useful app for avid readers/listeners to save a lot of money.","Since your last update, the audiobooks pick up somewhere behind where I left off. Sometimes it's the beginning of the track, sometimes it goes 60% behind where I left off. Sometimes it holds my place if payed and I answer the phone, sometimes it goes back to the beginning. I'm so frustrated! This is the only app my library uses, so I'm forced to use this app. I need the ability to trust the app will hold my place like EVERY OTHER AUDIOBOOK APP!

Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2.

I would like it more and would definitely play it more. But the reward from effort ratio in game currency is a freakin joke. And the ad rewards are a damn insult. It would probably cost you less to operate a real airport than get yours in this game off the ground. This game could be awesome. Lower the damn prices on everything and raise the rewards for operating the airport 🤬. Until then. This game is grounded 😡.","The game play could be good but the money system is broken and it's almost impossible to earn enough money in any reasonable amount of time to do anything except let guests visit. The effort to reward ratio is skewed and even if I thought it was worth putting money in the game $10 gets you a single upgraded runway with a few coins left over and once stuff starts breaking plus upgrades it's impossible to do anything.","Game was fun starting out. But at lvl 10 everything is outrageously impossible to buy/fix/upgrade with income you earn. I understand that it's for profit but if everything needs upgrade/repairs at the same time. You can't afford anything to advance in the game. Was about to purchase a coin package but it's still not enough to do much. $10 package gets you 17k coins. 1 Runway is $15k, you have 2. need $6k city hall upgrade to build more houses. $4k terminal, $8k repair station etc","I give this 2 stars cus it's a cash cow game. How are you going to make everything well into the thousands of dollars and only give the player chump change to build with? I love the game the don't get me wrong it's the greed of it that is a dealbreaker..... Update Deleting this game complaints don't get results and progress would take centuries!!!","I have no idea how, but I notice that somehow they charged me $49.99 on March 1 for \"A Stack Of Coins\". I didn't even like the game and had already deleted it and now I notice the charge.. I deleted it because it was sitting there never being played taking up space on my phone. I reinstalled it today to see how many coins I allegedly bought, and it started a brand new game, no coins. No history of what happened.

Now, I'm stuck with it. It doesn't automatically open the book like it did in the beginning. Nook now stores most of my books in the \"Cloud.\" I'm not impressed with \"Cloud\" storage. Furthermore, Nook now acts like it needs an intervention. It acts like it's addicted to both uppers & downers! I like the idea of having books at my fingertips. I just don't like what my Nook has become. A drag.","I've used a Nook for years. I hate latest update. The feature that allows you to skip back and forth in book without having to turn each individual page doesn't show up most of the time. Same goes for ability to change font size. The \"improvements\" that predict how long it will take to finish a chapter or the book don't make up for what was lost and aren't something I need.","If I could rate this nook device (Lenovo tablet) with zero stars or a negative rating, I would. I can't save any of my ebooks to my SD card, the area is grayed out & the button doesn't work & Google is imbedded in the tablet's software seems to think that my tablet's a phone. It's hard to flip back & forth on the tablet & the software doesn't allow me to change users very easily. I really wish that I'd just bought a regular tablet.","The reading speed function is extremely annoying and you can't turn it off. I want to know what page I am on not how fast I am reading. I love my nook but this latest update of reading speed has dropped me from 5 stars to 3 and the 3 is being generous. I understand some may like knowing how fast they are reading so at least give us the option to disable it","Last update completely ruined Nook reading. Takes so long to load a book get a msg asking if I want to continue TWICE. Many times it has been impossible to even turn a page of the book I am trying to read. If I didn't have so many unread books I would probably ditch Nook and go with Amazon. It is as if whoever did the update wanted people to ditch this reader.

And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Block City Wars: Pixel Shooter with Battle Royale","description":"5..4..3..2..1..

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

Its fun and keeps me fairly preoccupied. The biggest issue I have with this game is the customer service. I spend more than my fair share purchasing game packs. The one time I had an issue with mafia city's system updates, I reached out and all I hear were excuses as to why theh are unable to give me back the gold I purchased (by the way).","I'm still giving this five stars. Let me summarize some reviews and clarify some things. This game is fun. You can make friends from all over the world. You have the opportunity to learn different languages, customs, and holidays. There is a lot of money that you can choose to invest. You can also have a lot of fun playing and invest time into developing your game account by spending nothing. At no time do the developers twist your arm to make you spend. Give it a try, but don't be a hater (:","To exspensive once you get past a certain level and the in game GM sucks at responding to messages. My leader went from 27-30 and got no rewards at all for it and now i can't look at my messages or items while in city view gotta go to my mansion view to look at them collect rewards donate to clan ect... And as always GM doesnt respond back. Lower the prices and fix the game! Its getting annoying!!","Love this game have been playing it since college in 2014 even friends from the game now on Facebook. Just wish it was easier for you to get resources instead of it taking so much time they need to update that shouldn't take that long if you could move quicker in this game you'd probably have more people playing even though you have to spend money it's still amazing 💯✊🏾","Pretty good experience . Didn't require much money to gain rank and power. I enjoyed myself. I can't give it a higher rating because theres slot of pressure to buy gold packs."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.yottagames.mafiawar","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yottagames.mafiawar&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Zenly - Your map, your people","description":"Zenly is a map that lets you know what your friends and family are up to.

If you solve this problem then there to nothing to say any negative point of this application. Thanks.","The ads make this app very creepy. Like you are such an invasive friend and a terrible one if you use this app to check on your friends when they say \"oh battery's dead\" or something. That's creepy. Plus half the things you say in the ad doesn't make sense. Any way you advertise this app is just gonna make it look creepy and kinda stalkerish. Other than that, your replys to most of these reviews are quite nice.","Zenly is a very cool app. I used it every day. After that, I updated the firmware version and now it does not work ...

One thing we should definitely be able to \"count\" on is time. This app has trouble. If I set a timer, it shouldn't alarm 1,2,3,4,5 minutes after the time still counting how much time has past since it should have rang out. All thumbs down.","Does everything I expect from an alarm plus clock widget. Easy to use. Love the Skip function. Please do NOT add seconds, but a simple calender (any format) would be wonderful. Wish you could make the app available on non-ASUS phones also :-)","Please make the Background of anlogus and digital clock in verious color Because when them is change image of clock is not show clearly or make the digites of clock in different colors thanks . YOUR COUSTOMER (DIPAK AHIRE) from INDIA","Wow, you've managed to irritate me with a clock. After the new update, setting up an alarm clock comes with a vibration when scrolling through the numbers and there's no option in the settings to turn it off. The first thing I do on a new phone is turn off vibration on tap, yet you decided that I must have it in this app regardless","The new updates cause the app to constantly stop or crush. The app doesn't update the time which makes it unreliable and pointless. Who needs clock app that doesn't show you the correct time? Because of that neither timer or alarms work properly. Thanks to this 'amazing' app I was late for work, because neither off my 3 alarms went off. To say that I don't recommend would be and understatement."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.asus.deskclock","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asus.deskclock&hl=en&gl=us"}]
