I could search songs, nothing glitched, it was amazing. But eventually, I wasn't and still aren't able to search songs. The first page it opens when you click on the app, says that the service is offline. And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Free Phone Call App, Free Texting + Calling Number","description":"Dingtone, a free calling app allows you to make unlimited free phone calls, send free text messages to anyone.

I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth! Had huge glitch on my game play, took a couple of weeks to fix, they got it done!!! Thank you all. Awesome job well done. Totally locked in forever. 👍👍 Once again the Tech Team has stepped up to Excellence. Thanks 😊 7.21.21","Fantastic idea ! 2 stars missing because this game does not load properly. Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game.

So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.wikipedia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Crowd City","description":"Become the biggest crowd in town!\r\nGather people accross the city and crush your opponents with your overwhelming leadership!","descriptionHTML":"Become the biggest crowd in town!<br>Gather people accross the city and crush your opponents with your overwhelming leadership!","summary":"The real crowd experience!","installs":"100,000,000+","minInstalls":100000000,"maxInstalls":169785742,"score":4.2005763,"scoreText":"4.2","ratings":1582729,"reviews":692910,"histogram":{"1":186901,"2":57031,"3":94182,"4":158206,"5":1086407},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$0.99 - $3.99 per item","size":"84M","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4 and up","developer":"VOODOO","developerId":"VOODOO","developerEmail":"support@voodoo.io","developerWebsite":"https://www.voodoo.io","developerAddress":"4 rue Jules Lefebvre, 75009 Paris","privacyPolicy":"https://www.voodoo.io/privacy","developerInternalID":"8306041507631589049","genre":"Arcade","genreId":"GAME_ARCADE","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HvcVIhfvIqWsobFVDbz6sxgh0sNXVYKGwjvq5uGiDaCyPi7hOSjqvQaWQbs793HvTyEf","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/16TZlIlZBl0quEtGN0NAxBeel-YkZTV-oof9oVpB_mZXYaUBo2QRXGDzEJpSpMbxEQ88","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0XnP3hPTdl_nvMiJ2re-VKuIx5rHaDrOu_vkIVkG1oicyZmf6QnrlaywRyP2hKXhTGnZ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/g3AQH-kEJhivY0GCiDFeYEFW0NUrJtKP1Cz5LSeFndrsmvGipano-riutx1Ia6a5QQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qyB9upno49I1w5lcCxO0CQsvL_Qz_gfza8mImltpSHd0vSFbSkLxySh-BODanS9X1Ev5","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6-eU7wCJn7PumG2CSNEINxRMjhW46E_cjHN3hxSpVFsncVEdfAe65cEYXwqVco6RskUh","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IQdqYtLPBBT584ETFYFrwNHozyckPXRPGzhOY40--UUhsIy5D28zJ6-7qspl_ie32dE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1K87Oee3L2FaA7xwNmuEqqgfOWzXcTi67mJ2DqBVDHCz884rou0edBlpMdJogHVrxu0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fylEeHdEuGCY_ZYQxzOFZ1787wRjsM-1jo3Yhpp7G6Y34jfjKNEZCjkSVVsMEjB_MHw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GIvhN9Tr6_QULulMt_MNxuGLR_0yWhEfoII3U9ltQkMVQP7chtWUap7KFvBStc85eIQ"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Feb 19, 2019","updated":1627056507000,"version":"1.8.0","recentChanges":"Minor bug fixes.","comments":["I love this game, it's very fun to play.

The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!! And for the RICHIE RICH PEOPLE out there that loves to spend $$$$$ then go play Mobile Strike Gaming and you'll feel right at Home then tooo!!!! Lmfao🤣🤣🤣🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣","What the hell happened to the graphics it's all blotchy and can't even read words. This game has fallen far since 2015 it's also still extreme pay to win, I don't recommend playing this game unless you have some kind of business to support the money you will need to spend, so yeah garbage game still."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.epicwaronline.ms","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epicwaronline.ms&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"LINE PLAY - Our Avatar World","description":"Be the best you!

I made really good friends and it breaks my heart to leave them behind just because a stupid update won't let me continue playing! It would be much bettet if you didn't have to do so precise information for the account! Please fix this problem! I love this game and I don't want to leave it behind again! By that I mean I've had the game before and the same exact problem happend! Fix this please!","It's a cute app at times, but.. This is the least f2p player friendly app I've come across. If you don't have coins, your options are extremely limited. For example, much of the gacha are coin-based and only some feature diamonds, meaning you get bottom of the barrel items most of the time (if any). On top of that the diamond currency is also hard to acquire. Want to try to get items in events? Sorry! Those aren't very f2p friendly either, disappointed.","here are some things I'd like to see in the game: 1. being able to get the materials you want while trading with neighbors: it'd make crafting a lot more easier 2. the recording button 3. a way of leveling up the VIP status apart from the in-app purchases 4. the daily gems earned watching ads 5. the option to change your LinePLAY birthday to your real one 6.","This game is really the best game I played. But I would give it 5 stars if my account lasted. Everything was working very well when I tried to open it once and it showed me the screen the is shown when you have just downloaded the game. I tried to register my account but it said the my account wasn't even saved in line play. Please fix this I really loved this game and I don't want to uninstall it. I'll be waiting for an answer from the developer and make it fast.","for an expensive game, your staff sure have little care for fixing simple bugs. or is it intentional that you refrain players from watching ads, so they will purchase overpriced game currency? we pay with our time for viewing them, have some decency. frankly, all you have left is good item designs. even the new boss raid requires money to get the nicer prizes. when I said listen to your players for once, I didn't mean to give them more things to SPEND REAL MONEY ON."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"jp.naver.lineplay.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.naver.lineplay.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"India News, Latest News App, Live News Headlines","description":"NewsPoint is a news app that presents the latest news in crisp format from trusted national and international publishers.

This app is amazing... but the issue is. On my galaxy A11, the app works smoothly when I open the app, then after a few minutes staying on the app it starts to lag. When it gets really bad it either locks up my phone, black screen, and or the app closing out by itself... I want to enjoy the full experience of the app because I love to explore. Thank you.","Typing in the search box was impossible. Letters were erasing themselves as I was typing. I updated my Gboard. The same thing happened. Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.) Also a really useful feature would be a wildfire layer in Voyager.

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Top Speed: Drag & Fast Racing","description":"Dominate your criminally insane rivals in extreme head-to-head drag races!\r\n\r\n• Pick from 69 cars: stock rides, dragsters, and police vehicles\r\n• Let your creativity flow through a ton of tuning and customization options\r\n• Drive in 5 city districts, each with its own unique theme and gang crew\r\n• A real-life inspired aircraft carrier to race on\r\n• Epic arcade game modes\r\n• Adrenaline inducing Most Wanted police chases\r\n• Mind-blowing 3D HD visuals\r\n\r\nReach impossible speeds by expertly timing gear changes and bursts of nitro\r\nTop Speed is setting the new standard within drag racing genre.
