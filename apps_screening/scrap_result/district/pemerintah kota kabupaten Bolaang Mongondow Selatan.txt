Loss of a star","Like other recent reviews, I have used this app for some time, but now I can't get past the opening pelican screen. I tried reinstalling, but that made no difference. I tried a device restart - no difference. Update - Just for the heck of it, I tried opening the app the next day and it worked. I did nothing different between attempts. Maybe it was that cup of Birds & Beans coffee in the morning before trying again.","The last so called 'bug-fix and performance improvement' update messed up the app. My locations and alerts are gone. Even if i add a new location it does not show up, preventing me from adding a sighting. Been more than a week still no fix. Please roll back the update and revert to the last stable version. Cleary, basic testing was skipped before rolling out the update. Very disappointing.","Love this app and its features. No annoying ad popups. You can search for just your area, or birds by color, size, and more. Lots of interesting info on the birds such as nest behavior, feeding behavior, range, and more. It has their different calls and a lot of pictures for reference.","App is nice until it doesn't work. It lost all my locations after about a month of use. The sightings still show their original locations, but my list of locations to select from is blank. If I make new locations, my old sightings won't be connected with them.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff. There are no good stuffs about the game bro.. fix your game"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"block.app.wars","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=block.app.wars&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Wikipedia Beta","description":"Welcome to Wikipedia Beta for Android!

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Free Music MP3 Player (Download LITE)","description":"MixerBox Lite is a popular All-In-One media player that lets you Play Free Music & TV Shows.

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!! Good quality service with no worries about this app . All others I have used seemed to always have issues. Free phone app I have yet to see any problems. They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering. All this while the credits recharged automatically 3 times in less than a month and every charge was for $5.99, BEWARE!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.dingtone.app.im","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GO Music - Offline & online music, free MV, MP3","description":"Enjoy online & offline music streaming of millions of trending songs on demand.

Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included . This will limit their use on mobile ."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"World Building Craft","description":"World Building Craft is #1 sandbox block world crafting simulator.

It will do the job but make you hate yourself for it. The interface is very heavy feeling and at times a pain to navigate. Its like trying to take a detour with no signs. They have catagories... sorta, but I am convinced it was just a program vomiting content after a night of cheap liquor. It has the vibe of a designed team that remember their assignment 3 hours before the deadline. Bring a GPS you're going to need it to find your way around.","More adds than video content. Often the videos fail, but don't worry the advertisements never do. If you try to rewatch a 10 second clip that recently failed, you'll have to watch the advertisement again, which never fails to run. Unacceptable for a company as large as it is, and owned by Disney. Get it together boys and girls....You should be better than this. I pay a monthly subscription for this, rediculous!","Incredibly terrible app for this size company. Load times are awful, there are 30 second unskippable commercials that freeze, so you wait 2 minutes to watch 25 seconds of content followed by more commercials. The watch app is terrible, I have espn+ membership but I'm unable to watch games that are on broadcast television like ABC, because I don't have a cable membership. Their watch section is laid out terribly and it's vague what you are able to watch with your membership. So bad.","If it weren't a dang monopoly, I would've deleted this app years ago. Slow load times, has no problem loading 40 second ads, but then won't load the 10 second highlight you came to see. But wait, try to find the highlight anywhere else, and it'll kick you back to their app. Please, for the love of God, can yahoo, or fox sports, or literally anyone make a half decent app for sports. I'll take it over this dumpster fire any day","Horrible lag in the app. Also it does a horrendous job playing videos. The big issue is the handoff from ad to content. And even when the video is playing, of you change the time on the video, it won't respond and will skip the video. Would have expected a lot more from a big company, bit the app has bee.

What a waste of time it was you need different speed ups for different things like troops for example there is no generic speed up for all troop types but multiple types of speed ups you can only use for certain class plus for me to progress from where I left I have to spend a tonne of money I cant upgrade or do research unless I buy packs this is not a free to play game. It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!! And for the RICHIE RICH PEOPLE out there that loves to spend $$$$$ then go play Mobile Strike Gaming and you'll feel right at Home then tooo!!!!

And make sure the ladders are useable if u added them, and b4 the ladders rise up, maybe make a feature like us controlling the ladder in the basket.

Just add more achivemenys also so that we can level up in google play","Graphics are good , but aiming and attacking are bad. Aiming is not good , and there are less levels in this game","This game is very awesome because the AR version of this game is very good and the stingfly are very cool. The stingfly hits her opponents when they are looking opposit site. I like the game very much so i rate 5 stars on the game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.heliosinteractive.ben10","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heliosinteractive.ben10&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Blocky Cars: tank wars & robot games","description":"Welcome to the creative pixel car & tank world of Blocky Cars!\r\nWhat’s this online game about?

It's pretty fun! There's several rooms, enough to keep me busy and entertained. And the characters are also very silly and creative which I like.. like there's robots, astronauts, bubble guys and fish too. The best thing about it was all the stuff there was to grab and click on... And it truly represented a real hospital with all the different areas including the waiting rooms and parking lot where the ambulance pulls in. 👍","my cousin can't play every time my cousin go's in the app. she watches a ad to unlock the rest of the floors but it freezes. and never lets her in the app there's no x button to go back into the game. then she resets the app same thing happened. please fix this for my cousin she plays on tablet by the way. she keeps on bothering me so fix this glitch. Edit: yes I can see the ad I deleted the app then installed it still same thing it's stuck the number the timer that tells you when the ad is over","I would give this game 5 star rating but it isn't PERFECT, its fun and inspires you and this goes for every game of Pepi I m disappointed because I can't have ALL of the levels of the building. You can watch a video but that only gives you 15 minutes to play with every thing. Please fix this and make all levels playable without ha b ing to play","It's fun to know but you have to watch and add every time a timer runs out and it doesn't even give you that much time I would rather just not download the game at all because there's barely any rooms that are free you have to watch ads to get them and the ads are so long I rather you just pay for the entire game then have to watch it at every time you want to play it","This game is amazing! I can take care of patients and heal them if they have broken bones! I can also take care of babies in nursery, and so much more! I love this so much, This is the BEST hospital game ever! And because I wanna grow up to be a doctor, this inspires me even more! I highly recommend this. I can watch an ad to unlock everything for 15 minutes! It's worth it, and I'm very happy with this game! It is so much fun and it's also really educational for kids. I give this a 10/10!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.PepiPlay.PepiHospital","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PepiPlay.PepiHospital&hl=en&gl=us"}]
