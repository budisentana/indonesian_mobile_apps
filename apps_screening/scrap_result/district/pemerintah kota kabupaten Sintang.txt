This app is amazing... but the issue is. On my galaxy A11, the app works smoothly when I open the app, then after a few minutes staying on the app it starts to lag. When it gets really bad it either locks up my phone, black screen, and or the app closing out by itself... I want to enjoy the full experience of the app because I love to explore. Thank you.","Typing in the search box was impossible. Letters were erasing themselves as I was typing. I updated my Gboard. The same thing happened. Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.)

Just connect your phone to your car’s built-in display and take advantage of easier and more responsible access to navigation while you drive.<br><br>This update also brings smarter routing, better search and new functional design, including redesigned maps.","comments":["Offline functionality is unreliable. Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Exploration Lite Craft","description":"An amazing infinite blocky open world to build, craft and explore.

I will get a notification every hour telling me it's looking for incomplete downloads. Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included . This will limit their use on mobile ."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Waplog - Dating App to Chat & Meet New People","description":"Waplog Dating App\r\n\r\nThe fastest-growing dating app with more than 90 million users worldwide.

Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn’t start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful. But looking past the spam bots, it's a decent game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.craftgames.worldcrft","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craftgames.worldcrft&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Zenly - Your map, your people","description":"Zenly is a map that lets you know what your friends and family are up to.

If you solve this problem then there to nothing to say any negative point of this application. Thanks.","The ads make this app very creepy. Like you are such an invasive friend and a terrible one if you use this app to check on your friends when they say \"oh battery's dead\" or something. That's creepy. Plus half the things you say in the ad doesn't make sense. Any way you advertise this app is just gonna make it look creepy and kinda stalkerish. Other than that, your replys to most of these reviews are quite nice.","Zenly is a very cool app. I used it every day. After that, I updated the firmware version and now it does not work ...

It has minor issues of real time. Street view doesn't always work, even after I previously did a street view of that location. This app would be perfect if I could program my own route. I'm an escort (Pilot car) for oversize loads. We have routes issued to us by the states and counties. Plus, sometimes I don't like the route, google maps offers. One last thing, I wish we could switch to satellite view AFTER we hit \"start\". Thank you!","For quite a while I couldn't get voiced notifications. So, I decided to \"Google\" it. It said, delete cache and data. It seemed to work fine. I have just done an 8.5 hour journey that should have taken 5.5 hours. No fault of Google obviously. However, 3/4 of the way through the trip, the notifications stopped. Then 30 minutes before our journey end the voiced notifications packed up. If this does not alter I'll try 'Waze', it looks a much better option.","Never uses the most direct or fastest route. I entered my destination and it said it would take 1 hour and 40 minutes on the fastest of the 3 options of routes it gave me, which I knew was way off. I used another navigation app and reached my destination in 50 minutes. Other times it has taken me off the beaten path in an unfamiliar city and through some very bad neighborhoods when I could have stayed on the interstate and reached my destination much, much faster and safer. Do not recommend.","This application is always inaccurate with time tracking. It also makes serious errors which make the driver lost. It also makes it hard to see future directions. When it does a good job it is excellent but when it doesn't it is highly frustrating. The app made a mistake and said Jefferson hwy was Jefferson heights and kept sending me to the wrong location. It also gets lost in the French quarter. It is frustrating and can cause loss of employment and lost time in one's life.","Maps has not been working properly for me for the past month! It won't load the map and when getting directions, it wants me to take the longest, most ridiculous route to get to my destination. It also loses signal often and gets lost, or will tell me to turn at the very last minute causing me to miss turns.

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff.

And, further, it would be great if you also remove bar of icons for date, time, and battery etc. 2) With the increasing use of mobile phones, laptops, and tabs we are facing an issue of eye strain. So, eye strain could be reduced if you stop using blue color for hyper links -- blue color is bad.","This app is generally good and for the most part is worth every byte. The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","Love the app but at the moment, the fact that text inside \"expandable\" tables (for example, in the Loki TV series article, episode summaries) is rendered as dark text on a slightly less dark background (when in dark mode), making significant portions of many articles illegible. One star because of this. Five when fixed. 😐","It's incorrectly caching images. Some articles rely on frequent update of data in graphs and the app only shows the cached image until I manually clear the cache. The preview of the image updates but upon tapping on it the cached one is loaded instead the current one. Months later: Anyone there? Another bug: Clicking on a link in google opens the app but not the article. Only the last viewed article/tab. This is the case the last several months.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More).

It will do the job but make you hate yourself for it. The interface is very heavy feeling and at times a pain to navigate. Its like trying to take a detour with no signs. They have catagories... sorta, but I am convinced it was just a program vomiting content after a night of cheap liquor. It has the vibe of a designed team that remember their assignment 3 hours before the deadline. Bring a GPS you're going to need it to find your way around.","More adds than video content. Often the videos fail, but don't worry the advertisements never do. If you try to rewatch a 10 second clip that recently failed, you'll have to watch the advertisement again, which never fails to run. Unacceptable for a company as large as it is, and owned by Disney. Get it together boys and girls....You should be better than this. I pay a monthly subscription for this, rediculous!","Incredibly terrible app for this size company. Load times are awful, there are 30 second unskippable commercials that freeze, so you wait 2 minutes to watch 25 seconds of content followed by more commercials. The watch app is terrible, I have espn+ membership but I'm unable to watch games that are on broadcast television like ABC, because I don't have a cable membership. Their watch section is laid out terribly and it's vague what you are able to watch with your membership. So bad.","If it weren't a dang monopoly, I would've deleted this app years ago. Slow load times, has no problem loading 40 second ads, but then won't load the 10 second highlight you came to see. But wait, try to find the highlight anywhere else, and it'll kick you back to their app. Please, for the love of God, can yahoo, or fox sports, or literally anyone make a half decent app for sports. I'll take it over this dumpster fire any day","Horrible lag in the app. Also it does a horrendous job playing videos. The big issue is the handoff from ad to content. And even when the video is playing, of you change the time on the video, it won't respond and will skip the video. Would have expected a lot more from a big company, bit the app has bee.

Even tho every other app I'm using is working fine and a bandwidth test says I have a connection good enough to stream HD video. The help section has become basically non existent. I can't even send a message to get help in the first place. Every time I try it acts as if I want to export the log to some other app. I have nearly 200 credits and I can't even use them.","This will work in a pinch. Like when you brick your phone and are waiting on a replacement. I had a rather negative experience otherwise. I did offers for minutes because they don't tell you that you only have like 15 starting and it uses them to call. I got ripped off on an offer after 30 minutes of work. The ads take up literally more than half of my chat box so I have a hard time seeing my messages. I'm glad my new phone is coming today because I'm over this and uninstalling.","This app is infested with ads, forst of all. Second of all when I purchase credits, I expect them to be in my account right after the purchase. It has been a week and I have not yet even received the credits I purchased. 4 stars for this? I can't even contact dingtone because that part of the app is bugged. Do not use this app. I am starting to believe that this is a scam service.","This is the best phone app out there!!!!

They are the first phone app to stand by their word!! You'll be glad that you are using it. Many thanks to the creature of Free Phone call App!!!","BE VERY CAREFUL!!!, the credits that I had for texting dissapeared when some fake conversations started to happen from contacts I don't even have, they would continue to text me like if I was answering.

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly.

It is not like it used to be. The UI is worse than the old one, everything is too big and to much swiping. I think the licenses to the cars are expired so you can't see any real car badges or even the name. Yeah pretty much it. It is bad now. if you want to play drag racing games, just download CSR or Nitro Nation (which is a CM game, better (3D) version of this game)","I am sorry to say this but this game has become really complicated now with the new menu and interface ,I used to play this game a lot before and I have beaten it many times back in 2016 and beyond , I got say I liked the simplicity of the game when it was new but now it's totally a mess , please revert back the game to the original classic drag racing where navigation was easy and simple and the menu was also very well designed back in the old updates, this new update is a total disappointment.","Terrible game. Very one dimensional. Got tired of falling behind on every launch on 'DRIVERS BATTLE' despite following all the indicators and getting 'perfect launch' message, so I guess I will just not play anymore. If your car isn't maxed for it's level, 'DRIVERS BATTLE' is the only way to grind currency, and it gets old in minutes. The devs have been jacking off for the last what, 7 years now? I think I'll just download hill climb, or better yet, just stare at the wall. thanks for nothing","Disappointed... Back then when this game cannot connect the data to Google Play Games, they help me to recover the lost profile. Then after play it for a loooong time, they upgraded the game so it can connect saved data to Google Play Games. Now they reset it, my old profile built with hours and hours of play...... disappeared.. And the simple game becomes very complicated..","Disappointing game. I am one of your fans but once I get in its said that the game stopped working! please fix this problem and also thx for adding the new modifications to the game. Buuuut I was encouraged to play this game again because of new updates soooo I'm back in the game buuuut that's not enough I want the old car dealer cause you can search infinitely."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.creativemobile.DragRacing","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.creativemobile.DragRacing&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"WWE","description":"Download the WWE app for:\r\n- WWE news and announcements\r\n- The latest results from every pay-per-view, Raw, SmackDown and NXT\r\n- WWE Superstar profiles and title histories\r\n- Access to live event tickets and official WWE merchandise","descriptionHTML":"Download the WWE app for:<br>- WWE news and announcements<br>- The latest results from every pay-per-view, Raw, SmackDown and NXT<br>- WWE Superstar profiles and title histories<br>- Access to live event tickets and official WWE merchandise","summary":"Download the WWE app for the latest news, announcements, results and more!","installs":"10,000,000+","minInstalls":10000000,"maxInstalls":37855133,"score":4.487765,"scoreText":"4.5","ratings":787943,"reviews":228708,"histogram":{"1":58621,"2":14655,"3":27795,"4":69568,"5":617302},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$9.99 per item","size":"18M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"WWE, Inc.","developerId":"WWE,+Inc.","developerEmail":"appfeedback@wwe.com","developerWebsite":"https://www.wwe.com","developerAddress":"1241 E.

As a WWE lifer, I am extremely disappointed.

What a waste of time it was you need different speed ups for different things like troops for example there is no generic speed up for all troop types but multiple types of speed ups you can only use for certain class plus for me to progress from where I left I have to spend a tonne of money I cant upgrade or do research unless I buy packs this is not a free to play game. It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!!
