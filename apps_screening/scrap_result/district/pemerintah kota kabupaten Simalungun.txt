And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard.

Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Waplog - Dating App to Chat & Meet New People","description":"Waplog Dating App\r\n\r\nThe fastest-growing dating app with more than 90 million users worldwide.

Problem with that is that the notification will not let you close it out and it stays on screen for hours at a time. Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a 🔐 screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self.

This app is amazing... but the issue is. On my galaxy A11, the app works smoothly when I open the app, then after a few minutes staying on the app it starts to lag. When it gets really bad it either locks up my phone, black screen, and or the app closing out by itself... I want to enjoy the full experience of the app because I love to explore. Thank you.","Typing in the search box was impossible. Letters were erasing themselves as I was typing. I updated my Gboard. The same thing happened. Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.)

However, I picked it up again after a few months and loaded my old profile. Every time I am taken to the new hangar tutorial, the game freezes and all the buttons disappear on the screen. Would be nice to get that fixed if other people are having the same issue. Android device. Thanks! :)","I don't know what's wrong, the application (game) couldn't open after update and I will not be happy to loose this game on my phone.","Great game. Purchases a little expensive. Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly. I'd give 5 stars but the competitions get a bit repetitive and their frequency means your alliance missions don't get completed"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameinsight.airport","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.airport&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Wikipedia","description":"The best Wikipedia experience on your Mobile device.

The UI is a little clunky but a good attempt. I don't see much of a need for stuff like the history function, and same with the recommendations based on history, I actually think they kinda weigh the app down. Still, great app.","The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The \"more\" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The \"tabs\" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top.","I thought a Wikipedia app was redundant since the website already exists, but saving articles offline, transferring them between devices, and the clean reading experience with dark mode makes this app and a new account worth it to me. Haven't tried editing with this app yet though. My biggest issue so far is that \"Explore\" should be easier to get to, especially from an open tab. The tabs themselves took some getting used to after coming from iPhone. Small tweaks needed in that area.","It used to be fine, but now in dark or black mode, a lot of text is white on a white background. This usually happens in album track lists or TV show episode lists. Wikipedia kind of uses a white table to display the information, but keeps the text white on top of this table. The only way to see the text is to select the text (as of you are going to copy it) or if the text itself is hyperlink.","UPDATE: layout\\design. App auto-updated itself 2 days ago. (Thanks glitchy PlayStore!) Now app looks 1st gen: bulky & bloated. My previous ver showed (3) \"In the news\" thumbnails; now only 1. PREVIOUSLY; Tech glitch: occasionally, my Favs are cleared w\\o warning (and without clearing app or Samsung Note 5 caches or data). Current open tabs remain, but favorites are deleted.

It's pretty fun! There's several rooms, enough to keep me busy and entertained. And the characters are also very silly and creative which I like.. like there's robots, astronauts, bubble guys and fish too. The best thing about it was all the stuff there was to grab and click on... And it truly represented a real hospital with all the different areas including the waiting rooms and parking lot where the ambulance pulls in. 👍","my cousin can't play every time my cousin go's in the app. she watches a ad to unlock the rest of the floors but it freezes. and never lets her in the app there's no x button to go back into the game. then she resets the app same thing happened. please fix this for my cousin she plays on tablet by the way. she keeps on bothering me so fix this glitch. Edit: yes I can see the ad I deleted the app then installed it still same thing it's stuck the number the timer that tells you when the ad is over","I would give this game 5 star rating but it isn't PERFECT, its fun and inspires you and this goes for every game of Pepi I m disappointed because I can't have ALL of the levels of the building. You can watch a video but that only gives you 15 minutes to play with every thing. Please fix this and make all levels playable without ha b ing to play","It's fun to know but you have to watch and add every time a timer runs out and it doesn't even give you that much time I would rather just not download the game at all because there's barely any rooms that are free you have to watch ads to get them and the ads are so long I rather you just pay for the entire game then have to watch it at every time you want to play it","This game is amazing! I can take care of patients and heal them if they have broken bones! I can also take care of babies in nursery, and so much more! I love this so much, This is the BEST hospital game ever! And because I wanna grow up to be a doctor, this inspires me even more! I highly recommend this. I can watch an ad to unlock everything for 15 minutes! It's worth it, and I'm very happy with this game! It is so much fun and it's also really educational for kids. I give this a 10/10!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.PepiPlay.PepiHospital","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PepiPlay.PepiHospital&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Opera News: Breaking Local & US Headlines","description":"We’re proud to be enjoyed and trusted by over 350 million global users.

There are too many ads and also I also had trouble for some time keeping the Bluetooth connection when I open the app and play a radio station or podcast or anything on the app. I know there is nothing wrong with me Bluetooth speaker. My speakers are fully charged and I can play everything else on it. Can you please look into it?","I used to enjoy this app more in the beginning but now not so much. I could add and delete songs and it would only play the songs I added. Now you can't delete any songs and it plays random songs not added by me. Also you can't add any Garth Brooks songs. I even tried the free trial for premium and still no luck. I tried to listen to Garth Brooks radio with unlimited skips and I heard one song from him and skipped over 50 times and nothing. I am currently looking into other music options.","Commercials, Commercials, Commercials! If you like Commercials, then this is the app for you. Every time I use the app, I have to FIRST LISTEN TO FIFTEEN COMMERCIALS before I actually get to the station. I upgraded to the plus service, but to no avail. I'm giving it two stars because after you manage to listen to all of the Commercials, it actually does what it should."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller&hl=en&gl=us"}]
