Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features. I just want to use what I have bought, nothing more. please remove those unasked pop-up ads. it wasn't used years ago."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sygic.aura","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Koran Berita Papua dan Papua Barat","description":"Koran Papua dan Papua Barat adalah aplikasi berita yang mengumpulkan semua berita terbaru dari berbagai sumber warta berita dan Media online terpercaya di Papua dan Papua Barat. \r\n\r\nAdapun Aplikasi Koran Papua dan Papua Barat menampilkan seluruh di Papua dan Papua Barat, meliputi:\r\n\r\nProvinsi Papua Barat:\r\n\r\nKabupaten Sorong\r\nKabupaten Manokwari\r\nKabupaten Fakfak\r\nKabupaten Sorong Selatan\r\nKabupaten Raja Ampat\r\nKabupaten Teluk Bintuni\r\nKabupaten Teluk Wondama\r\nKabupaten Kaimana\r\nKabupaten Tambrauw\r\nKabupaten Maybrat\r\nKabupaten Manokwari Selatan\r\nKabupaten Pegunungan Arfak\r\nKota Sorong\r\n\r\nProvinsi Papua:\r\n\r\nKabupaten Merauke\r\nKabupaten Jayawijaya\r\nKabupaten Jayapura\r\nKabupaten Nabire\r\nKabupaten Kepulauan Yapen\r\nKabupaten Biak Numfor\r\nKabupaten Puncak Jaya\r\nKabupaten Paniai\r\nKabupaten Mimika\r\nKabupaten Sarmi\r\nKabupaten Keerom\r\nKabupaten Pegunungan Bintang\r\nKabupaten Yahukimo\r\nKabupaten Tolikara\r\nKabupaten Waropen\r\nKabupaten Boven Digoel\r\nKabupaten Mappi\r\nKabupaten Asmat\r\nKabupaten Supiori\r\nKabupaten Mamberamo Raya\r\nKabupaten Mamberamo Tengah\r\nKabupaten Yalimo\r\nKabupaten Lanny Jaya\r\nKabupaten Nduga\r\nKabupaten Puncak\r\nKabupaten Dogiyai\r\nKabupaten Intan Jaya\r\nKabupaten Deiyai\r\nKota Jayapura\r\n\r\nKoran Papua dan Papua Barat juga memiliki fitur notifikasi yang akan otomatis memberikan pemberitahuan saat ada berita terbaru yang dipublikasi.

What a waste of time it was you need different speed ups for different things like troops for example there is no generic speed up for all troop types but multiple types of speed ups you can only use for certain class plus for me to progress from where I left I have to spend a tonne of money I cant upgrade or do research unless I buy packs this is not a free to play game. It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun. The only way to get peace shields now is through loyalty and that gets used up real quick.","I used to play Mobile Strike back in 2015, and I thought this year to give it another shot. I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing. U say it's free to play but no u have to spend 1000s and u will still be out to date within a week. I wish u guys wouldn't of made the game like this I really enjoyed this game alot but it's not worth spending all the money I can see buying some packs for speed ups and supplies but having to buy packs for everything is just ridiculous.","Love the Game and Love playing it BUT once u start you'll b hooked like I am BUT it does costs $$$ to continue playing n growing your Base/HQ\"s into a Good Base too!!!! And for the RICHIE RICH PEOPLE out there that loves to spend $$$$$ then go play Mobile Strike Gaming and you'll feel right at Home then tooo!!!!

Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game.

I avoid it unless I need to use the saved log in info. Plus it has a constant feed that can't be stopped, if you touch anywhere it goes there","Far out one of my best I always prefer google is really awesome for some reason I feel good having and dealing google apps well that's me .

Often times it turns off all audio on our Honda Odyssey. We can't hear music, GPS directions, or regular FM radio. The only way we can seem to fix it is that we have to pull over, park, turn the van off, open & close the door, then restart the engine. After that, then the audio is allowed to play and we can hear directions, music, and the radio. Yhis happens with either phone. The last update did not fix the issue.","Does not connect to car even when connected with a high quality braided and shielded cable, and after factory resetting the phone and the car head unit. Very quirky behavior, it will refuse to even show on android app drawer. When tethered to the car 99% of the time the car simply ignores the phone. 1% of the time the car will connect wirelessly, and immediately disconnect. It seems Google has released an untested version on people.","Great app when it works, but still plagued with the bug where it cuts out randomly, and won't reconnect without fidgiting some settings or restarting the phone. It's NOT the cable, even though Google says that's the problem. It's on the software end. From dealing with this issue for months on end now, I've come to the conclusion it has something to do with when the phone is fully charged, the USB disconnects. Can be turned off phone side but Google code conflict is to blame. Look into it.","I love the android auto compare to Carplay. Why you might ask? Well for some reason in my Camry 2021 is multitouch but Carplay is not. And love that I have the music control on screen while driving. Forgot to mention the only problem I see so far is that sometimes while playing music. The music stop for like a second and then keep going.

If you finish a level it pulls up an ad. Now this is fine in most games because mostly all the games have ads, but I don't feel like you should put an ad every time we finish a level.

Now they have them at the bottom and side of the game. Not to mention to get a new vehicle you have to watch an ad. 😡 It also doesn't keep your progress if anything happens.

If you don't want to get frustrated. Don't play its boring and there's an ad every level. All you do is make sure to not crash a rip off game is way better than this.

Sehingga bahasa Moi ini termasuk salah satu bahasa daerah di Indonesia yang hampir punah karena jarang di gunakan dan tidak di implementasikan ke dalam dunia akademisi yakni; dijadikan sebagai mata pelajaran atau jurusan sastra bahasa Moi di sekolah dan perguruan tinggi.Dengan melihat situasi ini maka untuk memudahkan seseorang dalam mempelajari Bahasa Moi, dibuat sebuah aplikasi kamus bahasa Moi berbasis android.Tujuan dari pembuatan aplikasi kamus bahasa Indonesia-Moi ini adalah sebagai alat bantu untuk mempermudah pengguna mengetahui arti terjemahan kosakata dalam bahasa Indonesia ke bahasa Moi maupun sebaliknya, serta untuk melestarikan bahasa ini agar tidak hilang karena kemajuan zaman.","summary":"This application translates the meaning of the Indonesian word into the Moi language instead.","installs":"1,000+","minInstalls":1000,"maxInstalls":1257,"score":5,"scoreText":"5.0","ratings":14,"reviews":8,"histogram":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":14},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"3.6M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"Chandra Karim","developerId":"Chandra+Karim","developerEmail":"chandrakarim27@gmail.com","developerInternalID":"5687494212636044660","genre":"Books & Reference","genreId":"BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_OEpxh4C6j1JmIN8A1v8qN5how06HuHh6YAsSVub3VEweEONn8MBOoM_NQwNAQAFGw","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DAIZ2QmJGa6w9ST0GXoLXYFQlAkfDmX5W1lXrj_Ae0B8lfGtn4Vr86aitGDsNe1pVu4","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/X_MynTV5veBvfimaFKxQfSO1CZC97m4B_c2qFFXQwMVcvxoiaywNjKW6ZUN0KkZY6zJ9","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NeXOItxM3mL1e5K7Ed3B8yIxbaDJ0EsPCRl11utj8keFehmulvv7dmo41d-onmO6KC77","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GN1KTu1Xswi9w_W199Ax1hSLS7ruAlqYgcrQUiMicnYMUVMVALFQnQ4WKm5taxND_A","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Y70q2wgU3H8YHyyBzUz14VMzklP8NBtangGIYAwmkIm8KZqJ8PYT-uAmfulMPMsb7IU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QZe7jN5nNIXWj4ucq2uQx2J-31KJZhBVl5erR7pijaObQ3zAY59u7O6lCwPKFv3IMg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fl0qyepCg6KMRo59t5oJH3mROWgC3UO-VajzMp2HX0Rl-b9XHM2p-MGAtKUXHW5ITcK2","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OqOlQOdqMUgFuR0dENQjQWsxDqL0RBExQp5F63Fzkmx3gVROk0TvPXMYwSNKbli60MM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9lNnvbX2n23m0s3DXuDWxjpdM9MtvNcVe5P13AYG_AHfLQd8LVTFFefxwcthbKi0AQ"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Oct 19, 2019","updated":1572019890000,"version":"2.0","recentChanges":"Menghilangkan bug","comments":[],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"id.ac.akakom.chandra.kamusindonesiamoi","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.ac.akakom.chandra.kamusindonesiamoi&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PlayKids - Cartoons, Books and Educational Games","description":"Children learn to read, watch videos, and read ebooks.

Previously I was able to move photos to other folders and now it won't allow me to! This was my go-to app to create folder content and crop and edit my photos, and while I can still crop and edit, the fact that I can't move photos to folders is ridiculous, especially when in the menu the option to \"move to folder\" still exists! Please, please fix this asap Google! You say there are improvements and bug fixes? I don't think so!","I much more prefer this over google photos (which feels bloated and inconvenient to use ) but it still could be improved a bit - its a little annoying that it asks for permission to move files with every move and wish it could just be enabled in general - hidden or locked folders would be a nice added feature - selecting multiple images via the \"hold and drag\" like photos has it would be nice - also why doss the GO have to be included on the icon? it makes it stand out so much from any other app","I don't know if this is an Android side issue or app side, probably the former, but when I try to delete images, it asks for confirmation. Fine. It then asks again if I want to allow Gallery Go to modify this file (with no option to set a choice as default). Very annoying multi step procedure just to delete a single photo","I can't move pictures to different folders. I don't want my photos (either of they are from the camera or another source) to be in several places. I want to put them wherever I want. Don't know if it is a bug or a decision from the company, but if it is the second option, you make a huge mistake bro","I've liked it. However, I haven't been able to move files to different folders for a couple days. I do that constantly with my android. I messaged them.

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles. Will update my feedback as I continue using it"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.mapswithme.maps.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Army Men Strike: Toy Wars","description":"Play like a kid, fight like a man in a war without limits!

It worked fine on a couple of trips then went haywire again. very frustrating","Often it will spend a long time searching for alternate routes but only show me the original (no others to select). I will keep trying to see if it refreshed only to get the same result. This will go on for several minutes. This typically happens on my usual commute home from work. I never take the original way it intends but it never recalls the route I end up using.","It's consistently works & I have the ability to ignore when needed. However recently the app has been loosing direction when travel & will CONSTANTLY change mid drive.

App works on other phones in house fine, but this is a basic problem.","My favorite app. Wish it was a bit more descriptive like which Lane I need to get in Or if I can add things to the map to help me in the future. Or to add which route I would take automatically (like a preferred route) for places I always go. Like work and home and only adjust if there is construction or an accident that would be nice. Sometimes it doesn't connect to Spotify as well as I would like. Takes forever to load when first opening. Voice cntl would be nice too.

I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff. There are no good stuffs about the game bro.. fix your game"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"block.app.wars","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=block.app.wars&hl=en&gl=us"}]
