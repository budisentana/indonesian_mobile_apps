Being greeted with a message \"internet connection required\" at start up does not meet my definition of offline navigation. Good thing I was not in a situation where I had to rely on the app. Support request remains unanswered after several weeks. They seem to be more busy with trying to sell you more add ons then looking after existing paying customers. Edit: Thanks for proving my point. I've you'd read my review, and took it seriously, you'd know that contacting support is useless as I never received an answer.","I recommend the app based on features, but the price scheme is insanely expensive for new customers. This has been one of my go-to navigation apps for awhile. The app is polished, the controls are intuitive, live traffic works well and is useful, and the maps are reasonably up to date. There was a (long standing) issue with the voice instructions (that refused to say street names if the locale of the map is different from the locale of the app), but that issue is fixed as of 1 June 2021 so I could not be happier with this app. This being said, my happiness is supported by having a lifetime subscription purchased a long time ago. It was rather expensive, but at least was a one-time purchase. The current price scheme makes the app very expensive. Were I to be a new customer I would not even look at Sygic again. In all, one star goes off because of the price scheme, and another because it took so long (years!) to fix the locale issue.","Just don't do it... Even if it's the only map your moto nav will work with, it's not worth the frustrating ux or draconian pricing. Pricing from 2010 - \"hey, let's find a way to use \"Value Add Services\" to differentiate pricing tiers - but let's make them things almost no one needs and attach them to actual navigation. Oh, and then, if they switch platforms, we'll charge them to get something already free in app. We can come up with a bunch of confusing names, they'll never know. So much $!\"","When I first purchased the app it's very useful, but after 2 3 times updated, it getting worse, and specially speed limits alert, the older version I can set to 0, once the speed over the limited it will alert me, but new version had no where to set, I think it automatically set on over 10km then it will alert me, second one is, it not automatics re-calculate the route one I made a mistake, it keep telling me take a u-turn, very annoying thing, if you can fix that problems it should be good","navigation is good, but often not the shortest and easiest way is used. but most annoying is the advertisement. I already bought the app and upgraded some features. I do not want more to buy, but I always get fullscreen ads.to upgrade to new features.

This app has at least cut the calls 80 percent maybe a little more,. You can't stop them all but it is appreciated. Thank you,. Maybe one day there will be a way to get paid every time a scam number calls your phone you would be able to collect a dollar,. This app helps very much .","Dec 2018 - Perfect for my needs. Typically, the person's name or company name shows up too. May 2021 - I guess with 4G to 5G and T-Mobile and MetroPCS merging, this app has worked maybe 50% of calls, refuses to update or acknowledge my account, and even deleted the list of numbers that I added as Spam - into this app. Very disappointing. I've done updates several times (almost always does not update, as it can not authenticate me) & even try more than 60 mins, uninstall/ reinstall = no good.","It catches up 90% of these fools I think. It really does work. Just alot of work to add the #'s in but I really got the benefits for not having to deal with so many calls. I just wish it didn't cost so much to stop folks you never ask to call you. This is crazy. But even doe it cost way too much..I rather not keep getting these calls either. So far this one ranks high in my book but due to the cost I will be looking for a better one at a cheaper price for show. But I definitely give this one 2👍","Keeps crashing. Ever since last week the app keeps crashing and is no longer blocking calls. What is going on with this app? Edit- for those who see this, I believe the new app you need to use is scam block by metro t.","This app never shows up on my Samsung phone as an installed app, (never an icon either) yet now it wants to be updated and shows that it's installed? I also have no way to uninstall this app, which makes no sense because you have to pay MetroPCS monthly to use this application on your phone and I'm not paying for it.

How little sense this makes - more & more people are still working from home b/c of Covid, and will continue to work from home. So, instead of just opening the tracker in another browser tab, the developers in their infinite wisdom have decided that it is better if you unlock your phone, open the app, and then be able to locate.

What I like about this game is most buildings take inspiration from real world buildings, structures and skyscrapers. You can also customize and organize each district to your liking. The game goals are quite challenging but with stunning results so it'll be worth it. Now my city is quite huge with different types of buildings and skyscrapers. I would definitely keep playing this game for years to come.","Great Graphics, only thing that is not all that cool they don't have a state chat for everybody to communicate. Only time you can talk with anybody is if they join your alliance. 12/14/20 > one of the best tech support teams on earth! Had huge glitch on my game play, took a couple of weeks to fix, they got it done!!! Thank you all. Awesome job well done. Totally locked in forever. 👍👍 Once again the Tech Team has stepped up to Excellence. Thanks 😊 7.21.21","Fantastic idea ! 2 stars missing because this game does not load properly. Every time i start the game, i have to exit, and restart 3 times just to get it to load all the buildings. Even then a lot of things are missing","Fun, lots of things to do and endless interest. For those of you who enjoy management and building an empire of your own, this game is for you. Although, megabucks (secondary currency) is very scarce, if it were a little more common, I would rate it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a 4.","This is one of the best city building game in my life. Their are some advantages and dis advantages in this game. ADVANTAGES 1.this game was not only building a city, but also it likes building a whole country. 2.In this game not only has building. It also have military, airport, railway, minerals, space oruented,....etc 3.In each and every places has unique song i really have enjoyed it. 4.

I deleted the files but the app no longer runs without them. Is it so complicated to have a big button to just turn off the voice assist that to me is as annoying a Karen telling what to do?","It has changed a lot since I used it in the passed, less intuitive. Obviously need to read the manual and then re-review.","The app can take 2 or three tries to fully function in Android Auto. That's a problem. Also it does not matter what channel or volume you set in the app the voice engine will cut out source audio. You can have the voice or you can have silence but you can't navigate to a point and listen to anything without interruption. Unless there is a solution the developer will not share this app is not ready for Primetime.","Closing the app in system task manager caused that all my saved routes GONE! Same thing with blocked roads edited by myself. All gone. Need to fix this or set a reminder for users that they always have to close the app proper using 'Exit', not just killing it in task manager. BTW. 'average speed' panel doesn't work.","Maps not bad (OSM); interface/search atrocious. Example: asks for country; type United it prompts with Kingdom, back up, type States - frowny face. Must type name of state, which isn't a country. When you get a possibility there is no \"show on map\" except in various unfathomable contexts. Getting beyond Last Search takes gymnastics and a few MAJOR shopping centers in my area not in database. So, free, navigation OK, UI big flunk. Needs real user input + UI/workflow redesign.

Not reliable for anything other than the cities. When used for driving the results were not so great until yesterday when it proved to be downright DANGEROUS.  The road we took following maps me should have never been included in the options. The first part of the road is slow, but the last part turned out to be the road used occasionally by the logging trucks. The road was full of holes, fallen branches, wood debris, no cell phone coverage.","The app provides a lot of info other apps don't and the maps have a nice look. I'd use it more often but there is one extremely annoying thing: After years of existence they still not manage to let the town names be shown correctly. No, it is not the settings, it is YOUR programming of the app. Why do I need to zoom out all the way to see the name of bigger cities? Why are you not capable of finally changing this?","This was my go to app.. traveled in Iran, then Nepal, and all over Ireland and it was brilliant. Didn't need internet connection because I could download the maps in advance.. an essential feature that put this app head and shoulders above the rest Unfortunately, it's now been made useless. Now, the app only opens if you have an internet connection, making it completely worthless for traveling off the beaten track. Absolutely disappointed.. you had an excellent product and you killed it.","I use MAPS.ME for my motorcycle trips. It is the simplest and best option that I have found. I paid to have the ads removed, and the low yearly cost of a cup of coffee is worth it to me. Other apps are way too complicated! MAPS.ME is perfect for the 2 things I need: 1 Show my custom GPX KML KMZ route on a map while offline. --- It is super simple to add new routes. I email the route file to myself and open that email on my phone. I can instantly add the attached route file to MAPS.ME 100! 2 Show me where I am while offline. --- I mount my phone to my handlebars and ride all day long with MAPS.ME open in landscape or portrait mode. 100! That's all I need for my motorcycle trips and MAPS.ME does this perfectly. Other apps like Gaia, Avenza, onX and the rest add way too much noise to the experience. They are greedy data hogs and pester you with social sharing. MAPS.ME probably didn't plan for my simplified use case but it is by far the best for my needs. MAPS.ME FTW!","I'm pretty impressed by it. Have tried a few offline map app that claims to be offline map, but turns out to be s@#t. So how do you test if it work it offline mode? Just turn on flight mode when the offline map app and you can tell if it works offline or not. This has so far works for me. Easy to use and pretty good navigation too. I'm super sick of Google map routing me in circles after circles. Will update my feedback as I continue using it"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.mapswithme.maps.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Talking Tom Cat 2","description":"The legend is back!

Opened the app and it showed a single engine Pilatus turboprop. Also listed the wrong destination. I'm in the initial approach for HPN where this jet was clearly landing, but listed as heading to Montauk. This happened two other times in the last week. Been using app for years, never had this happen before. I updated app and still showed bad info. What's up guys?","Have enjoyed several years of silver level but notice planes taxiing to runway, waiting for ages, then gone, suddenly airborne at speed and off the screen. Used to be able to track acceleration and liftoff. It needs to be made clearer what times mean. I thought they were local to where the aircraft was, but I think they must be local to where I am, ie Auckland, NZ","I love this App and always use it to identify the Aircraft going in to my local Airport and to follow their journey. I find it very informative and entertaining and would recommend it to anyone with similar aviation interests. Update 6/8: I have just found that a lot of features are accessed by Search Bar and am absolutely loving it now. Upgraded to Silver Package. Well and truly addicted!","I love this app! I have a Gold subscription but as of lately its not picking up all the aircraft thats right above my head.....I can physically hear and see them, but they are not showing in my app...","Love thus App! I use it as part of my daily work as well as personal travel. Ads, when they are shown, are not overly long or constantly interrupting use.

Sales aren't that Greta for what is required in the game. One thing that I think can definitely improve is the coins and luggage. It doesn't build up the quantity if you leave them alone for the day unfortunately. I think that would improve the game for sure if they can do that. Because I can always be on the game.","A real time killer game!!!!...you can spend hours with it..need strategy to use the land provided very efficiently. The only negative point is the sources of income which is very low and limited comparatively with the prices for upgrading the buildings and for buying lands..please increase the sources and the amount of income. Otherwise it's very addictive. Thank you.","This game is very addictive, I have been playing for a few years now and still love it. It does take a while to get going properly with things being expensive but once you start getting your city built money does add up pretty quickly.

The first page it opens when you click on the app, says that the service is offline. And the music player that appears on top of the screen, for some reasons dissapears while I pause a song or just switch to another one. It's getting quite annoying and I don't know what the problem is.","Great App. very few commercial interruptions. Only issue I have is that certain songs you search for are only down loadable by imitation artist. But I guess that's because of infringement issues.","I've used this before, and it was great. But after while, the songs are not in an alphabetical order anymore. Local, playlist. I really love it's lockscreen feature, but finding songs without it being in the alphabetical order is hard. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work.","I am surprised the app even loads. I'm still waiting for my search request and its probably not gonna happen. I will give it one more day to impress me.","This app is bloody amazing, the only problem that I have is that it does not have a shuffle play button and it keeps on lagging, plus now when I want to create a playlist it does not show 'create' it only shows cancel, if you fix this I'd rate this app 5 stars"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jiubang.go.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiubang.go.music&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Go: A lighter, faster way to search","description":"Google Go is a lighter, faster way to search, with search results optimised to save up to 40% data.\r\n\r\nGet answers quickly and reliably with Google Go, even on slow connections and smartphones with low space.

I think it deserves 5 stars but I have an issue. It is a bit different from Google, not just talking about its visuals. When I want to open a site from photos, it doesn't have a option. When we click on people also search for, we start getting more similar questions but it doesn't provide that. But since I needed it, I tried to install Google but it always says I can't because I have a similar app. I need you to do something about it. Beside that, it is totally awesome!","I use this because it's not as bloated as google, but there's some really stupid features. Like the fact it keeps telling me that I made an illegal request by modifying my search. Or how when I'm browsing links from the search results, it suddenly has connection issues and hangs, or how about giving users the ability to shut off lite mode? And finally, the home button is in the worst possible place for a tablet because I often accidentally hit the button when I set my tablet down every time!!!!","Keeps popping up a box saying Google lite is ready even though I have it turned off, super irritating, also don't like the auto word fixing during search, leaving me to go back and make changes while it leaves actual misspelled words in the search but changes the words that I made sure to be entered exactly as they need to be to find that info. I avoid it unless I need to use the saved log in info. Plus it has a constant feed that can't be stopped, if you touch anywhere it goes there","Far out one of my best I always prefer google is really awesome for some reason I feel good having and dealing google apps well that's me . Just makes me feel like we're on same frequency's and that's exactly why I'm satisfied even though trying other apps. I end up on same place. so don't get me wrong the mayority off times it has being a tremendously learning Exp. Nevertheless I find my self more. comfortable with google. and you might say I'm a freak not at All I'm Loyal. It's how I operate.","A little notification box pops up that says Google lite is ready now. It forces you to use it, even though the information you wanted already came up. It will continue to loop like this if you continue to search for more things.If you do select Google lite, it starts the search over from the beginning, despite the progress you have made.

I've reset it, change setting, deleted locations and time and again it sets my home location as Norridge.","Good before until now, now it's showing me a screen with clouds and nothing loads to see weather and data. I also paid for the premium service and was using it before and now nothing, I cleared cache and changed location tracking to ALWAYS but still same. Please tell me how to fix or send me an email to email you and then I may consider changing the stars. Thanks","Been using this app for more than two years now. Pretty accurate and the UI is very clean & easy to read. Love the widgets as you can adjust the transparency. Weather forecasts for different locations within a town makes it even better than other weather apps. Great job, devs!","Trying to like this on Android, but why does the font get smaller for the temp that is displayed in the status bar when temp gets triple digits? It's small enough to begin with, even noted your sample screenshots here on Play Store have the status bar temp 'magnified'. Can you make it more readable?","I had originally gave a 4 star due to the fact of issues with radar,but I have changed my rating to a 5 because of quick response from developer and the willingness to take suggestions on how to make app better. Thanks for the quick professional response and the desire to be willing to listen to customers for suggestions. The best weather app that's available, blows all the rest away!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.apalon.weatherlive.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apalon.weatherlive.free&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Zillow: Find Houses for Sale & Apartments for Rent","description":"Find tools to buy, sell or rent a home and keep millions of listings right at your fingertips with the Zillow app. Change starts here.\r\n\r\nBUY A HOME – Find your place with immersive photos, virtual tours, and the most listings, including things you won’t find anywhere else.\r\n\r\nSELL A HOME – Whether you sell directly to Zillow with Zillow Offers™ or take a traditional approach, we’ll help you navigate the path to a successful sale.\r\n\r\nRENT A HOME – From shopping on the largest rental network to automating applications, we’ve created a seamless online experience for renters.\r\n\r\nThe Zillow app gives you resources and tools you won’t find anywhere else, so you can shop smarter for your next home:\r\n\r\n• The most listings and constant updates so you never miss out¹\r\n• 3D Home Tours so you can picture yourself in a home and narrow down which houses to visit in person \r\n• Self Tour for Zillow-owned homes, with no appointment and no pressure.

It is time consuming to find a house but fustrating to read about a house that was a no way not ever - over and over and over and over and over and over...get the point?","As I'm in the market to buy, the app has been invaluable. But I wish there was a way of removing listings from suggestions. If I view a home and decide it's not for me, I should have a way to stop seeing it appear on my suggestions. F/I a beautiful 4bd2bth at 90k but it's in a high crime or flood zone. I can favorite, but I can't refuse to see it.","Seems to be getting worse instead of better. I like that I can go to the listing and it's accurate. I wish every listing would be consistent in showing the rental Zestimate at the top or show unavailable if it isn't. The information is usually accurate and I like that there is a link to the county website for the property I'm looking at. The worst thing recently is that I can't update my property info without a real estate agent. Also miss the option to see public view on claimed homes.","Really like the zillow app, would be nice if the app alerted me when someone makes an offer on a property I saved. Would like to get into bidding wars on properties I want to buy. Missed many properties I would have paid more for. Would like to see properties sold on an ebay type format once qualified. Agents are not good about answering questions or making contact through zillow.","Doesn't work anymore. I get an email notification of a new house on the market, but when I click the link the app doesn't open that house. Instead it opens a list of hypothetically related houses. It honestly looks like an embedded web page, and behaves like one. It doesn't scroll properly buttons don't work.

It was good back in the day, not now!","used to enjoy the game until it got out of hand expensive. The time is takes to build troops or do research (BT/KT days) is ridiculous and is no longer fun.

I couldn't even play the game, every action I do lags the whole game. I would have rated this 3-4 stars if it weren't for the choppy graphics.","When the game was first released it was by far the best mobile game on the market and then u guys got crazy money hungry and now it's not even worth playing.

There are some good features in this locator app, but but inaccuracy like this this often tells me I can't trust it.

That is not enough time, and to automatically start charging your Google Play account, I thought this app had a free version. I can't get to the free version. What ever happened to \"try before you buy? Edit: OK, it is possible to kill both\" free trial offer\" screens and try the app, just a lot of ads. I will always pay for any app that I use, but I want to try it first.","I can't figure out how to bypass the premium subscription, and I already have three other weather apps to get me by. This looked cool, but I hate having to remember to cancel anything. It never rains here anyway. Uninstalling.","It would be better if the wind forecast could be hour by hour like rain, temperature, and cloud coverage already are (maybe visibility could be 24 hours as well). Other than that the app's pretty solid. The lightning strike feature is nice for small craft, but I'm not sure how precise it is, so I'll still err on the side of caution.","Not too bad app, but it starts with the map animation, instead of showing me the important details for my main location (If I open the app, I want to save time and get immediately to the rgiht details - I can then spend time playing with the app later... if I want). IMHO too expensive for what it provides, and how it provides it, especially comparing with some other good apps.","Couldn't even get past a paywall to evaluate. A free trial means you don't need to do anything to use it, including making an effort to subscribe. UPD: sorry, my bad. Didn't notice the X button.

That is not true. Yeah you can see stars that are in constellations and Planets. But nothing else. Also, it doesn't let you search the sky via coordinates. So no, it's not at all what was expected as per the description. Or what Google says it is. Apparently they can track down you star you buy from Name a star. But it won't let you search the sky freely via coordinates. So I can't find the star I purchased from Starchives. Google Sky 👎","I have gyro and compass that I calibrated, and manually set location. The easiest way to check accuracy is by the massive ball of gas in the sky. It's off by an angle of 100+ degrees. Not sure I trust this app. I don't give one star reviews unless the app is misleading or offensive, but it definitely needs a way to manually calibrate the sky with the gyro. Maybe point camera at moon and then the horizon or something.","Really poor at figuring out the phones angles, the maps seems incorrect when compared to maps online and reality itself, and poor (or at least I can't find any) tools for seeing *or even checking* the current altitude/direction you are looking at.","The updated app doesn't seem to show current position properly. It says the sun should be 30 degrees above the horizon when it's just sunrise. I've tried on multiple devices and Android versions, and they all malfunction in this way. Specifically allowed location permissions to the app, confirmed high accuracy, but still off. However, the time travel works like champ. Hoping this gets fixed.","This program opened up the sky view for me. I played with the time travel portion and it helped me see when objects will be easiest to see. There does seem to be a little skewing on location, but it is still great!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.stardroid","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid&hl=en&gl=us"}]
