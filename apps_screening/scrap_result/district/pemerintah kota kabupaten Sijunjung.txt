I and many others cannot even play the game, as only a few seconds after you enter the game, it freezes and continues to run in the background. It only happens when you play for a while as I speculated. There are also many exploiters in the multiplayer servers that wizz around in the air and either use auto-aim or use a infinite grenade exploit that destroys other players. Please fix your game!","This is a great game! It is one of the best Block Shooter games ever and it isn't just a shooter. It has a cool Rocket League type mode, a racing mode, and a cool mode where your in a giant robot and you fight other players. The other modes it has are team mode, free fight, zombie mode, a cool pokemon mode, and it had a battle royale mode but I dont see it anymore. If they got rid of it, their dumb cause that was one of the best modes. Well overall it's a nice game and definitely worth getting!","The game is fun I have to say. But a multitude of players used hacks to gain an upper hand and proceeded to annihilate a whole slew of players from the top of a building. I've hit the multiple times with a sniper rifle. And half of those shots went to the head (a player survives 3 head shots on the first rifle). Please add more protocols and fix some exploits to even the playing field.","I love this game, but I need a couple of changes. Every time I try to load into a match my screen freezes and I am forced to log of, and this happens basically every match. And also, whenever I load into a match, there are always hackers that move at the frickin speed of light and destroy my mechs one hit. We need a reporting system.","Gameplay is good but theres lots of annoying bugs and stuff.. i'll say the bad stuff first, so first of all there are hackers who move at the speed of light and keeps on killing us with explosives, whenever i try to start a match my screen will freeze and will force me to log off, and then whenever i play single missions sometimes half of the missions i see are in a different language that i cant understand.. now for the good stuff. There are no good stuffs about the game bro.. fix your game"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"block.app.wars","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=block.app.wars&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Waplog - Dating App to Chat & Meet New People","description":"Waplog Dating App\r\n\r\nThe fastest-growing dating app with more than 90 million users worldwide.

Also, it tends to crash a lot and then my kids run to me squalling.","Needs to allow the whole screen to be locked so even if you touch the whole screen the video continue playing, just like the iphone have a üîê screen, and this will be good not just for you tube kids but for any other video player like you tube etc.etc.also the volume should be permanent the same on everyone videos because the volume is so annoying specially at the beginning or also just before ends, thanks you for your understanding ??????","Good app But, 1. Kids can exit the app and can use quick pannel of mobile by using navigation keys/ back button it self. It should be locked and should ask passcode to exit the app so that kids can not use any other apps of mobile phone. 2. There is no any language filter, we know only Hindi and English language but this app recommends many kids contents in other languagies, there should be filter which language we want to teach our kids.","Youtube Kids is a very nice app made for kids . It has feature of choosing your age , setting timer for watching video and making and choosing your profile picture and mamy more .. But I feel there should be a lock passcode in Yt Kids so that children cannot open the app after the timer is over and there should be a language choosing option in which all the languages will be included . This will limit their use on mobile ."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Smashy Road: Wanted","description":"SMASHY ROAD: WANTED\r\n\r\nYou are WANTED!

There is 2 bugs that I always get in my game. 1 is that when you run into a wall you get stuck in it you also get stuck in the ground. 2 is that when you get wrecked from an explosion your character goes through the ground which is very dissapointing. So please fix these 2 bugs because I'm getting really annoyed of them...","A very fun game, some lags and minor glitches, but the main reason it gets A star off is that if you blow up a tanker and are next to a mountian or something like that, you get stuck on top and can't go anywhere. Happened to me a couple times and it is kind of funny. Overall a good game.","It's a fun game when you don't have much going on, just steer left or right and the car does the rest. A good update would be to allow you to buy specific cars with in game currency for more as opposed to simply randomly doing it all the time. Maybe charge 500 to get a specific common as opposed to random for 100. Just a thought. Also, add some more vehicles like maybe a hummer or something. It's a really fun game though.","A quite fun game actually because it is simple to play. But the fun dried up after some time because of the repetitiveness. Not to mention some basic physics denial (A tank that could match the speed of F1 car ? Come on).","I used to play this game like 4 years ago and the legendary flipper was so good. I came back and played it and now the flipper is nerfed. It is such a slow car. Like it used to be overpowered but now they nerfed it too much. They could have slowed the vehicle's speed a little.

By that I mean I've had the game before and the same exact problem happend! Fix this please!","It's a cute app at times, but.. This is the least f2p player friendly app I've come across. If you don't have coins, your options are extremely limited. For example, much of the gacha are coin-based and only some feature diamonds, meaning you get bottom of the barrel items most of the time (if any). On top of that the diamond currency is also hard to acquire. Want to try to get items in events? Sorry! Those aren't very f2p friendly either, disappointed.","here are some things I'd like to see in the game: 1. being able to get the materials you want while trading with neighbors: it'd make crafting a lot more easier 2. the recording button 3. a way of leveling up the VIP status apart from the in-app purchases 4. the daily gems earned watching ads 5. the option to change your LinePLAY birthday to your real one 6.","This game is really the best game I played.

I'll be waiting for an answer from the developer and make it fast.","for an expensive game, your staff sure have little care for fixing simple bugs. or is it intentional that you refrain players from watching ads, so they will purchase overpriced game currency? we pay with our time for viewing them, have some decency. frankly, all you have left is good item designs. even the new boss raid requires money to get the nicer prizes. when I said listen to your players for once, I didn't mean to give them more things to SPEND REAL MONEY ON."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"jp.naver.lineplay.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.naver.lineplay.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"WorldCraft: 3D Build & Block Craft","description":"‚òÖWelcome to WorldCraft - Best Crafting and Building 2020 Game Played by Thousands of Players ‚òÖ\r\nPLAY NOW free creative online multiplayer games or survival exploration games.

But unfortunately we can't upload a survival world for me and my friends to play in private. The survival advertisement doesn't work for us when we try to install and I'm not sure why. I hope there are some changes to this app on where we can upload survival world in private. Because I think it be good if we people or friend could play privately. Please consider this.","The game is nice. But multiplayer disconnects you automatically for inactivity and I think it's an annoying feature, because sometimes you're just waiting for people to join your server and you can't just leave your character there waiting.","Amazing game but I have this one huge issue, I have a new phone since my old phone is broken, and I can still see that the worlds I uploaded still exist but I can no longer be the creator of it. I was trying my best for the world to reach more than 1000 likes and it already had 300, so I wouldn‚Äôt start a new world. Please help me out! I want to be the creator of my worlds again because now they are just read-only. I can do anything to become the creator again.","This is a good game, but just has one flaw. In multiplayer, there are always people spamming harmful and random stuff and they should let us have a vote to kick (kick out of the server for like 5 minutes) or kick them out if they spam more than 10 lines repetitively. Not only does this make the chat covered, but makes the game chat less fun.","I'd be rating the game higher, if your game wasn't being plagued by spamming bots to the point of no return. It's really bad. If you could do something to fix this issue, I'm sure that everyone playing would be greatful.

Option to buy parts for coins rather than just Megabucks would be great.

I like how clean and straightforward the UI is. I just wish that casted podcasts would play at the increased playback speed.","Amazing app. The app UI sleek and straightforward, eliminating distracting clutter, and overall has a good feel to it. Although, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about my experience with podcasts in general. This app helped me fall in love with fiction audio dramas, which is a medium I wasn't expecting to enjoy. I can listen while driving or cooking, or I can just sit back and let my eyes focus on nothing in particular. Overall, my experience has been phenomenal.","Really like this app, especially the ability to speed up podcasts in 10% increments, unlike other apps which use increments of 25%. Two things that would make this perfect: 1. Additional functionality in the playlist like a multi-select feature and move to top/bottom option. 2. Ability to rewind/forward from the lock screen widget instead of having to unlock it every time. If forward is disabled for advertisers then at least give us the ability to rewind.","I use it daily. Player shows as 2 different apps in recent apps, which is a weird bug. Variety of other issues but nothing too major. Downloads/play only seem to work for rather recent pods, and if you find some interesting stuff from say 2012, they won't download or play for some reason. Crashes have become less frequent (thanks devs!). Still my go to for podcasts. Submitted as requested. Can't get pic of the 2 instances showing up as it's doing it in android itself when bringing up recentapps","Google pixel 2 - using app for 3 yrs - app feedback/ bug reports don't seem to be helping. Since the addition of a queue a while back (was much needed), I always download and add episodes to my queue simultaneously. Now, episodes are randomly removed from the queue and cannot be re-added (they remain in downloads but the \"add to queue\" flashes green and then back to blue). Not to mention the second instance which appears as a blank screen in the apps list any time you open the app. Needs work."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.podcasts","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.podcasts&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Kiss Kiss: Spin the Bottle for Chatting & Fun","description":"Tired of the traditional kissing games?

As a WWE lifer, I am extremely disappointed.

A lot of unskipable ads and even when they're done the only way to go back to the game is clicking the screen and then it takes you to the game's page then you finally get the X mark to exit the ad! It's so annoying!! I never experienced this problem in any other game ads. Untill you fix it... I'll rate it with two stars","The game is pretty awsome and have some potentials too but it still had a problem 1:aiming with sniper is extremely hard maybe try to reduce the sensetivity when using any iron sight 2:try to fix also the walking pathway for the npc they are roaming anywhere in the map i even accidentaly run over them and now police are starting to chase me 3: try to add functioning light pole it could be usefull in night time and cars should have functional head lights at night time. Thats alk hoping to fix it.","YEEEESSS, the update I have been waiting for is here, This is one of the best open world styled game, and these are the review of most of the stuff 1. Wacky Animation: TOP Tier ;) 2. Controls: Nice 3. Graphics: BEAUTIFUL(even if you disagree idc) 4.
