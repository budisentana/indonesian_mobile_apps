I like a lot of the features but this app totally let's me down as a parent because my kid can actually download apps without permission or approval if the game/app is advertised in another game. I reported it, went a couple of levels with tech support, sent them videos but all I finally get is for me to go and play and record games to figure it out for them and prove it. I'm not a developer nor an app expert. I've had to resort to just denying permission for it.","Great app. I've used iOS screen time on Apple devices and this for our Samsung tablet that my son uses and Family Link wins hands down. The app time controls are clutch. Some more granular control over allowing apps internet access would be helpful. For instance, let me allow tablet network access normally, but let me turn off access for certain games (Minecraft, Among Us, etc).","great so far. excellent tool for helping kids learn responsible phone use Location services, and app permissions are excellent. Funny how with the push of a button from your phone, their phone won't work. All of a sudden the bathroom is open, or they respond to your text.","1. One of my kids can still do image searches and pull up porn even if searching is blocked and set on safe search. 2. I would like to put time limits on categories. Like have my kids only play an hour a day on all games. 3. Would like the ability to control who my kids can call. Other than those three things, it's honestly the best working Android filter as my teens can easily get around all of the others.","This is the most unsafe application because it doesn't work on many android devices such as tablets and samsung TVs etc so then you wouldn't be able to use them with your kid's account. You are obliged to disconnect those devices from Family Link then run an adult account which is unsafe for your kids.

And then lose, and then have to wait and scrounge all over again until I can play another game of bingo. So thats why no 5 stars.","I'm slightly addicted. Not enough to spend money, but enough to play outside of rewarded play time. I only discovered it through a rewarded play app, trying to win money, not spend it. But, it's a great bingo game. There are many, many fun extras, there's definitely more than meets the eye. There's also a nice variety of ways to earn extra credits but when you're slightly addicted you run through those quickly. All in all, one of the best free bingo apps I've played.","This is my favorite Bingo game. It doesn't get boring but I do think they should give more free chips per day or lower the chips you have to pay per card. I can only play like 3 games per day since I can't afford to spend money on it. I might would spend a few dollars a day if it wasn't so expensive. I think the chips are way to high of a price.","There are so many Bingo apps out that it's hard to choose one. I absolutely love Bingo Bash. (The only other one that is on the same level of fun, for me, is Bingo Pop.) I've leveled up & I'm playing in fun rooms, and contests. My problem is I can never play more than a couple games per day without spending IRL money. Now that I've done that 2x, the prices for a handful of chips soared. I don't win like I did at first either. UPDATE: Since passing level 25, the entire game has changed. 5 stars!","Terrible! You pay for premium cards and still can't win. What a waste! The same people win again and again. The numbers don't make sense that with that many players the same ones win all the time. Also, they need more bingos per game. Is there anything you can buy with all these stupid coins, you should be able to buy bingo chips with them like you can in some other games. The bingos might be randomly called but the SAME PLAYERS keep winning. Even with FOUR PREMIUM cards you can't win."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"air.com.bitrhymes.bingo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.bitrhymes.bingo&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Megapolis: city building simulator.

It's extremely frustrating. Also if you add audio tracks it pushes everything in that line back.. so if you add something to the beginning you have to edit every single audio clip that was on the line. I've spent countless hours dealing with these issues but could easily be fixed and save people lots of time..","It was working fine before, but since the last update i've noticed that when i switch to another app and go back to editing, all my progress is gone! It starts at an empty slate. Never had this issue before. frustrating to have your work gone, when before i always just picked up where i left off even when i turn off my phone.","It is the coolest editing program for my phone. I recommend it. I edit all types of videos on it and the result is good. Ps:Video Layer for example when I make a reaction I want to film myself on camera then I want to put video over video plus why he took that phase where the sound is from, that is, where it comes from, it's harder that way where it comes from I hope to solve these problems.","4 stars because it not easy to use for a novice like me. Learning curve is a bit of a challenge with some feature options without explanations attached. Have to watch a number of videos to learn how to use. Its a good product but takes a bit of practice and lots of mistakes for a beginner with little knowledge and experience to make a good video. Will like it better when i get the hang of it. Quality product without a doubt. To Power Director team: Consider apps ease of use for novices. Thanks.","Tried it and it looks just like something I've been looking for, but to get much out of this, you have to pay. This is a demo, not a fully functioning app. The prices don't seem outrageous, but the description of this app should clearly state somewhere that it's a demo. The app developers should offer this as a paid app with all basic functions enabled forever if you buy it. This \"subscription\" stuff is disingenuous app nonsense.

Ok. The multiplayer is over hyped, the campaign is fun, but after a certain point becomes unplayable unless you feel like spending a bit of money. I love the models, but when it comes to combat it's obvious that this game would be better played on a tablet. I feel like they made this game for hardcore fans that have never heard the word \"casual.\" Idc if I'm a noob, I want to have fun, and this game gets very sweaty, very fast.","The game is pretty good. The campaign is neat, but only focuses on Khornian space marines and orks as enemies. They could've expanded and added a tyranid chapter, or maybe some tau; but that isn't a real issue. The only actual problem I have is that multiplayer is completely rigged against you when you're new to multiplayer.","Edit: saw update in 30 July, only bug fixes, don't play with my heart, dev. The best Warhammer 40k games on mobile. Period. I tried Spacewolf and various TCG Warhammer game on Android and Freeblade is the only game that I can't put down. Finished the main story, got the top wargear and doing super well in PVP. It's a shame that the game seems to be abandoned by the dev, last update is more than a year ago, so many potential wasted. Hopefully this game can get some love or sequel!","I have played this game for about a year now and it never has any bugs, but it keeps crashing for no reason, I havet good storage and wifi but it just randomly crashes for no reason can you please fix it. :(","This game is really fun, making you feel like a god and destroying hords of enemies, i personally love the melee combat its super flashy and epic."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.pixeltoys.freeblade","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixeltoys.freeblade&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Phone by Google","description":"Google’s official phone calling app is now available to download for the first time.

No dropped calls or calls cutting in and out. Has always been very reliable. I would recommend this as a download if you don't already have it on your phone. I love the spam detection feature a lot as well. Keeps me from doing my \"FBI cyber crimes division\" routine for unwanted calls.","Superb app, but I hate the call recording feature, because it announces that \"This Call Is Now Being Recorded\", to the hearing of the person on the other side, once the record button is pressed. It is particularly embarrassing, when I'm on call with a very respectful person and my cheek mistakenly presses the button, most of them end up terminating the call, querying the reason behind recording the conversation.","Such a worst app which I have ever used. It has poor quality design which doesn't allow to make the things easier. And I can't even record a call without knowing other person who's call I'm recording, Recording announcement is audible to both the people in call, doesn't allow to record conference call. Such a horrible experience by Google. I have been searching for uninstalling this app but I didn't find any way.","Really bad experience with this app. There is no much gestures. Announcing as \"This call is being recorded\" is the worst idea. When someone called and trying to threatening us, we usually record that call. when this will announce we really get into danger.

The gameplay is great and maybe a few Rangers are mildy OP, but the game is great.","It was a very nice game. WAS... Because every new character that comes out has a super power, and is like GOD, cant lose...the old characters are left as trash.. Even the \"balance\" updates are a joke...","The most addicting app I've ever played. It's only \"Pay to Win\" if you need it to be. All the Rangers are well-thought out and perform exciting actions. One of my favorite fighting games of all time.","Despite being a fighting game, players don't have to crash mobile screen by tapping rapidly. It is simple and fun. The graphic is awesome. The great thing is collecting the favorite rangers/villains and Megazords could be really exciting. However the rematch isn't available though. Some charaters are extremely overpowered. Hoping that could be balanced soon. I wish there is a feature when a player can go on an adventure. Overall, it is really a nice game if you are a fan of Power Rangers.","If you dont have alot of money dont play it its pay to win bassicly when you get like a higher tier your gonna see way stronger people than you if you dont spend money and if you dont wanna spend money you have to grind 24/7 but if your good and use tactics you can do it PS you cant block stronger characters no matter what"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.nway.powerrangerslegacywars","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nway.powerrangerslegacywars&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Pepi Hospital: Learn & Care","description":"Step into a PEPI HOSPITAL and become doctor, patient or just a curious explorer!

It's pretty fun! There's several rooms, enough to keep me busy and entertained. And the characters are also very silly and creative which I like.. like there's robots, astronauts, bubble guys and fish too. The best thing about it was all the stuff there was to grab and click on... And it truly represented a real hospital with all the different areas including the waiting rooms and parking lot where the ambulance pulls in. 👍","my cousin can't play every time my cousin go's in the app. she watches a ad to unlock the rest of the floors but it freezes. and never lets her in the app there's no x button to go back into the game. then she resets the app same thing happened. please fix this for my cousin she plays on tablet by the way. she keeps on bothering me so fix this glitch. Edit: yes I can see the ad I deleted the app then installed it still same thing it's stuck the number the timer that tells you when the ad is over","I would give this game 5 star rating but it isn't PERFECT, its fun and inspires you and this goes for every game of Pepi I m disappointed because I can't have ALL of the levels of the building. You can watch a video but that only gives you 15 minutes to play with every thing. Please fix this and make all levels playable without ha b ing to play","It's fun to know but you have to watch and add every time a timer runs out and it doesn't even give you that much time I would rather just not download the game at all because there's barely any rooms that are free you have to watch ads to get them and the ads are so long I rather you just pay for the entire game then have to watch it at every time you want to play it","This game is amazing! I can take care of patients and heal them if they have broken bones! I can also take care of babies in nursery, and so much more! I love this so much, This is the BEST hospital game ever! And because I wanna grow up to be a doctor, this inspires me even more! I highly recommend this. I can watch an ad to unlock everything for 15 minutes! It's worth it, and I'm very happy with this game! It is so much fun and it's also really educational for kids.

Best part is that you dont have to upgrade your bot really to beat the boss, maybe just one or two. Also, no need to really purchase anything, just do good combos. The only bad thing is that you have to get google play so if you delete it you dont have any progress, make sure you save the progress!! To help you if you have trouble winning, purchase these robots: UWI Ambush UWII Six Shooter WRB I Gridlock WRB Albino WRB- Metro Gold","Overall, this is a good game. But, I bought a bunch of stuff on my iPhone, and logged into Facebook hoping to transfer my games data over to my Android phone, only it find out that none of it transfers across phones, but I can still log into Facebook. This is a little more than anoying, and if there's a way to fix the problem, this is an easy 5 star game.","I'll start by saying that a few days ago this would've been 4 starts as it's a fun game but the energy system slows it down. Today I got on and the game told me I hadn't beaten UWI yet? How? I have two WRBII robots and I was getting ready to fight Zues. So I though eh whatever I'll play through it really quick. So I equipped my old UWI robot and tried to go through the championship again. I beat UWI logged on the next day and the progress was gone once again. I still have all my robots and stuf","OK, all I can say is 'OUTSTANDING' with brilliant gameplay, astonishing graphics and gorgeous mechanics of the game itself. This one's better than the boxing champions I'm telling you. Gives me back many nostalgia! Playing since 2013 (it's first release) and I see there's alot changes now that really improved the game and impressed me, the mystery draw was a great thing coz you can win alot of unique robots like Zeus, Atom, Cosmobot and more! Good job reliance!","This game I'm played in 2016..all the stages completed..after I deleted the game..now in 2021.
