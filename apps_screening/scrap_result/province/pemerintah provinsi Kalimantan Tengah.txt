I attempted to get it last year when I had a cheaper phone and I could only get it to occasionally work. Oh and it's only fair to mention that the so called 'cheaper' phone was considered a midrange LG K40 so not technically a cheap phone at all, but anyhow. I upgraded to a Stylo 6 which I suppose is still midrange, but the higher end of midrange, and I've not had any issues out of the app so far. Still, not the most intuitive app I've seen.","I cant get the app to load. I have 100s of game informers and it crashes 100% of the time. Cant read my issues at all. Hopefully getting the fastest speed internet, will help me . But I doubt it. I'm disappointed and feel like I've been swindled because I can't even read my issues I paid for","Works some times. constant issues trying to download issues, if the phone goes to sleep have to start all over. Once loaded reading and navigation works.","Can't even sign into my account which, it's worth mentioning, costs $15/year. My account is verified and my credentials work - I can log in on my laptop no problem. It's just this garbage app that's the issue. Have tried about a dozen times over the course of two weeks to log in, troubleshooting everything reasonable along the way. App always rejects my sign-in information as invalid or non-existent. Even beyond this unforgivable issue, the app seems clunky, poorly designed, and dated.","Terrible app and developers. The app almost never works.

Initially, it was great. The last three times I've tried to sign in, I've had to change passwords and I'm treated like a new customer, given a variety of subscription offers..when, as far as I can tell, the money is still coming out of my account. If I have to spend the time to figure it out every time I sign in...I'll just figure out how to cancel the subscription.","Honestly one of the best news apps I've used from a UI standpoint: the reading experience is pleasant, all articles load quickly and are beautifully formatted for phones, and the WSJ's famous graphs are sharp and sometimes even interactive. However, the number of notifications is absurd: despite setting my preferences to only breaking news, I get easily a dozen notifications per day. Some are for features or other stories that are definitely not \"breaking news\". It's annoying.","I recently changed phones, and I was reminded that, even though I must sign in to my account, the app acts as if I am a new subscriber. I have had to select again each columnist or feature I am following. Worse yet, after a month I have yet to receive a single notification for any of those settings. And, yes, I checked to be sure the app has permission to send notifications. None of my \"saved\" articles carried over, so they're not linked to my account.","DO NOT buy a subscription to WSJ from Google play. I have lost 32$ twice doing so. After a few days I was no longer able to access articles. My bank was charged. I tried everything (uninstall, log out, reset, etc.) When I emailed AND called I was told WSJ couldn't REFUND my money or help me get access to my subscription because Google handled it. What will I do? Call Google for a refund? 🤣 RIPOFF.","The app is currently a disaster of a reading experience. If the article has pictures, scrolling freezes and you have to swipe a picture a dozen times to get back to the article text. Totally PITA. Hope this is fixed soon. Until then, I'll archive articles to read online or at later date."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"wsj.reader_sp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wsj.reader_sp&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"5 Nashville","description":"WTVF NewsChannel 5 in Nashville delivers relevant local, community and national news, including up-to-the minute weather information, breaking news, and alerts throughout the day. \r\n \r\nWhen you open our app, you’ll know what’s going on right now and what’s important to your local area.\r\n \r\nWe've improved the experience with an intuitive layout and simplified navigation.

I love the Daily Wire and would love to give the app 5 stars but for some reason the app keeps crashing in the middle of me listening to the shows. Often times the app will crash several times in one show. I don't know if it's a bug or what the problem is, but 2 stars from me until it's fixed.","Wonderful source for political commentary. Very upfront about their biases. The app, however, is never quite right. Every time I install an update, there is some new quirk that doesn't quite work properly. Usable, but I still wish they could finally bring it all together.","The app has improved greatly since it's initial release. I've all but replace YT with the DW app whenever I'm consuming DW content. The only thing holding it back for me is the lack of comment section for the podcasts. Its the stand out feature that YT still has over the DW app. Specifically when it comes to shows like Matt Walsh's. Where comments are an actual part of the show.","I want to give 5 stars, but I can't until they fix the app. Whenever I click on an article, the banner image is blown up too large to see, and YouTube links only show a small corner of the video and random articles have portions cut off the screen without the option of changing screen orientation or zooming. Also at the top of the \"Watch\" page, the zoomed in affect is going on cutting off a large portion of the text introducing the new \"Morning Wire\" show.
