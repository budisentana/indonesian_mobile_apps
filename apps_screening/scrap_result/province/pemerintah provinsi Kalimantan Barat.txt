Letters appeared and disappeared without me touching the keyboard. In the unlikely event that it actually did pull up a location, zooming in took me somewhere else entirely. It also locks up my phone causing me to hard reboot. I had to uninstall.","Love the app, but I do have two small suggestions. 1. Stop defaulting the map style to Exploration. I have to keep switching it to Everything and I would rather the app just remembered my choice. 2. The historical imagery from the desktop version would be great to have in the app too. 🙂 Keep up the great work!","Amazing app. I love and enjoy working with it. So much details and research. Good work from the developers team. This app would be a 5 star if the tool of GO TO could be added. In that way you go from one point to the other. Suggest possible routes and estimated time and distance. In overall the app is my best.","I've been trying to view the California/Oregon damage from forest fires on Google Earth (Android) and I've run into a missing feature. Please add the ability to view historical imagery on mobile. (It obviously has the feature already done since it has timelapse, but it's no option to change the time manually with a slider.)

What earns a low rating is the \"Updating Location\" notification that is nearly omnipresent. No option to turn it off, make it go away, or have it otherwise not exist.

This one is more and more inaccurate, not just lagging. I'm getting Notifications that my kids have arrived at a location when they actually just left the location and visa versa. Just watched them walk out the door and a moment later the notification said they arrived at home. There are some good features in this locator app, but but inaccuracy like this this often tells me I can't trust it. And that is all I really need to know.","Recent update,, review changed because now,, maps never work. I was paying for this and now I'm glad I'm not. I used to love this app. it updated or something and now it never works. I refresh and it stays in the same location for hours. I turn my phone off and on, still says the same thing.

We have had this app for over a year and inspite of allowing it to run in the background we have had no success.

I'm an avid photographer and it was nice to not have to lug around an actual camera but still get great photos. Now I'm losing pictures because it gets stuck \"processing\" and I can't take new photos while it's doing this. (For up to 24 hours). Half the time the photos just vanish. Thought it was an HDR problem bit I turned that off and am still having issues. Have tried ALL of the support recommended fixes to no avail. Will not buy another pixel. 0/10","I love the camera on my Pixel 3. Night mode is the blast. Photo spheres are the best. But the app needs too much RAM. I got almost 4 gigs and after taking a quick pic (which sometimes takes ages -part of the problem I guess) all my other apps I go back to need to start from scratch. Extremely annoying for games. Can you please try to shift certain functions to loading on demand or something? Thanks!","I bought a Pixel SPECIFICALLY for the camera and the photo storage. Now after a year and a half of owning my phone, which might I add has no breaks/cracks anywhere on it MY CAMERA WONT FOCUS. I have tried all your non sense recommendations of clearing the cache and the storage, wiping down the lense, uninstalling and reinstalling the camera app. Why don't you be honest and say you screwed up our phones with some trash software update. FIX. IT. My camera stopped working the day I left for a trip.","More & more bar code scanning at restaurants, might be a good idea to add the short cut to the icon long press. Old: More and more settings get removed, Pixel camera is supposed to be top notch. Video especially, does not even have 4:3 option, please restore some basic features. Not to mention the whacky Slo-Mo, can't export with proper frame rate.","Great camera, but why are updates so finnicky? I have a Pixel 4a 5g on the android 12 Beta, and Ive never gotten the redesign with the focus buttons instead of the slider. Ive uninstalled, reinstalled, downgraded, upgraded, and everything inbetween. I should have this update, and even though the version number is right the UI is still the old version that doesnt work great.

I give it 3 because it's not free and should be.","Can't believe this isn't installed by default. Further, charging me $4 a month for full spam support seems opportunistic.

It gives me the freedom to make calls and texts over IP/WiFi or thru my phone plan. If I'm sitting at my computer I can call or answer in my browser. The biggest issue I've had with Voice is its lack of integration with Google Contacts. It maintains its own contact list and will not search my Contacts. Hey Google!

One really annoying problems though: when new messages come in, the notification bar blocks the text input field. tapping anywhere on the screen will just make the notification bar last longer. You literally have to stare at the screen and wait for it to disappear to start typing again, until the next new message comes in, wait for another 3 seconds.

And then lose, and then have to wait and scrounge all over again until I can play another game of bingo. So thats why no 5 stars.","I'm slightly addicted. Not enough to spend money, but enough to play outside of rewarded play time. I only discovered it through a rewarded play app, trying to win money, not spend it. But, it's a great bingo game. There are many, many fun extras, there's definitely more than meets the eye. There's also a nice variety of ways to earn extra credits but when you're slightly addicted you run through those quickly. All in all, one of the best free bingo apps I've played.","This is my favorite Bingo game. It doesn't get boring but I do think they should give more free chips per day or lower the chips you have to pay per card. I can only play like 3 games per day since I can't afford to spend money on it. I might would spend a few dollars a day if it wasn't so expensive. I think the chips are way to high of a price.","There are so many Bingo apps out that it's hard to choose one. I absolutely love Bingo Bash. (The only other one that is on the same level of fun, for me, is Bingo Pop.) I've leveled up & I'm playing in fun rooms, and contests. My problem is I can never play more than a couple games per day without spending IRL money. Now that I've done that 2x, the prices for a handful of chips soared. I don't win like I did at first either. UPDATE: Since passing level 25, the entire game has changed. 5 stars!","Terrible! You pay for premium cards and still can't win. What a waste! The same people win again and again. The numbers don't make sense that with that many players the same ones win all the time. Also, they need more bingos per game. Is there anything you can buy with all these stupid coins, you should be able to buy bingo chips with them like you can in some other games. The bingos might be randomly called but the SAME PLAYERS keep winning. Even with FOUR PREMIUM cards you can't win."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"air.com.bitrhymes.bingo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.bitrhymes.bingo&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Transparent clock and weather - forecast and radar","description":"Get accurate local or worldwide weather forecasts easily with live weather updates, hourly and daily weather forecasts and timely weather alerts.

But even when disabled, like almost every other app anymore, the app will start in the background at boot. And with the uneditable permission to access/pair with Bluetooth devices, it doesn't need microphone permission to be granted. My real concern is, why do even disabled apps startup in the background, if being disabled and set for no background activity, is supposed to keep the app from starting in the first place? I dislike that...","Live transcribe fairly accurately transcribes speech IF you are really close to source. It does not pick up across a room like other apps do. It doesn't differentiate between speakers. They really need to make it more sensitive. I've noticed, with everyone wearing masks, often no words are picked up. Additionally it often won't start unless i turn off phone and turn back on.","Works just as described I've been a pixel user all my life as I have the latest and greatest Pixel 5 and 4 others such as 2 Pixel 4 XL's and 2 Pixel 3 XL's and this works perfectly with all of them no mistakes what so ever and is very useful at times of need.

This release brings bug fixes that improve our product to help you discover new places and navigate to them.<br><br>Become a beta tester: http://goo.gl/vLUcaJ","comments":["This app helps me a lot, getting from point A, to point B. It has minor issues of real time. Street view doesn't always work, even after I previously did a street view of that location. This app would be perfect if I could program my own route. I'm an escort (Pilot car) for oversize loads. We have routes issued to us by the states and counties. Plus, sometimes I don't like the route, google maps offers. One last thing, I wish we could switch to satellite view AFTER we hit \"start\". Thank you!","For quite a while I couldn't get voiced notifications. So, I decided to \"Google\" it. It said, delete cache and data. It seemed to work fine. I have just done an 8.5 hour journey that should have taken 5.5 hours. No fault of Google obviously. However, 3/4 of the way through the trip, the notifications stopped. Then 30 minutes before our journey end the voiced notifications packed up. If this does not alter I'll try 'Waze', it looks a much better option.","Never uses the most direct or fastest route. I entered my destination and it said it would take 1 hour and 40 minutes on the fastest of the 3 options of routes it gave me, which I knew was way off. I used another navigation app and reached my destination in 50 minutes. Other times it has taken me off the beaten path in an unfamiliar city and through some very bad neighborhoods when I could have stayed on the interstate and reached my destination much, much faster and safer. Do not recommend.","This application is always inaccurate with time tracking. It also makes serious errors which make the driver lost. It also makes it hard to see future directions. When it does a good job it is excellent but when it doesn't it is highly frustrating. The app made a mistake and said Jefferson hwy was Jefferson heights and kept sending me to the wrong location. It also gets lost in the French quarter. It is frustrating and can cause loss of employment and lost time in one's life.","Maps has not been working properly for me for the past month! It won't load the map and when getting directions, it wants me to take the longest, most ridiculous route to get to my destination. It also loses signal often and gets lost, or will tell me to turn at the very last minute causing me to miss turns. Please make an update for this app to correct itself!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.google.android.apps.maps","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"free video calls and chat","description":"Agent for Android – easy-to-use free messaging and calling app. \r\nGroup chats, video calls, social networks VKontakte, Odnoklassniki support.\r\n\r\nAlways be in touch with such Agent's features as securely encrypted calls and high-quality video calls, speech-to-text for voice messages and an ability to create your own stickers. \r\nCustomize your communication and use animated 3D masks in video calls, create group chats with unlimited participants and channels!\r\nFinally, chat synchronization across all devices is available for your comfortable experience.","descriptionHTML":"<b>Agent for Android – easy-to-use free messaging and calling app. </b><br>Group chats, video calls, social networks VKontakte, Odnoklassniki support.<br><br>Always be in touch with such Agent&#39;s features as securely encrypted calls and high-quality video calls, speech-to-text for voice messages and an ability to create your own stickers. <br>Customize your communication and use animated 3D masks in video calls, create group chats with unlimited participants and channels!<br>Finally, chat synchronization across all devices is available for your comfortable experience.","summary":"Instant messaging app with Chat rooms.
