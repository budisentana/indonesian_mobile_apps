Has anyone else's got it fixed? and if so how? This is very disappointing it's my first Motorola phone and I bought it less than 4 months ago. This is very disappointing, I won't be recommending this phone to anyone as I see I'm not the only one that this happens to.","Very nice. Feature request: I wish the possibility for manual mode in video though. Like white balance, ISO, shutter speed. Sometimes while video recording almost static conditions there's some slight sudden annoying brightness changes, due to auto adjust. I guess it is the white balance changing automatically, but could be ISO or EV. Any chance for that option in future?","Moto Camera 2 worked fine until yesterday. Now the app opens but can't take any pictures, just the black screen with the camera logo in the center, Google Lens options to the right, and camera settings at the top but can't select anything. After a few seconds, the app closes. I don't understand the question. The Moto Camera 2 app won't allow me to take any photos.","the moto camera 2 app has not been working on my device for over 3 months now. when i attempt to open the app, it immediately takes me back to my home screen or says \"Camera has stopped working.\" for other apps, ONLY my back camera works. when i try flipping to the front camera on those other apps, it continues to stay on the back camera.","Camera doesn't work when I need it to, not even after restarting. I am able to use the camera feature in other apps so it's not hardware related. Very disappointing to miss photo opportunities because the app won't open."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.motorola.camera2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motorola.camera2&hl=en&gl=au"}
